<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SURVEYOR RUFUS AND HIS FRIENDS</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">All</span> aboard for Raccoon Bluff. Those who
can't get aboard take the rail route! Hi! Elmer,
squeeze in!"</p>

<p>"On deck, Lil Artha; but do you expect me to
climb on top of that mountain of camp duffle, and
other luggage you've got piled up, so that your
car looks like a tin peddler's outfit?"</p>

<p>"Oh! we've reserved just one crack for you,
Elmer. That's right!" sang out the khaki-clad
boy at the wheel, "work your way in alongside
George Robbins, who's holding down the rear
seat with Lil Artha. I've got Alec McGregor
beside me here. And after all, worse luck, I had
to leave some things behind that I wanted to take
the worst kind."</p>

<p>"What's this sticking out&mdash;a gun? You ought
to know that it's the off season for most kinds of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
game, Lil Artha," expostulated the latest passenger,
as, following directions, he painfully forced
his way into the heavily laden car.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, and I don't intend to do any great
stunts at hunting, Elmer. I only thought it might
be good policy to fetch my little reliable Marlin
along, because sometimes it's mighty pleasant to
know you've got some means of defense handy in
case of trouble."</p>

<p>"Hear! hear!" ejaculated the boy answering to
the name of George Robbins, and who it may be
said in passing&mdash;for the reader would soon find it
out anyway&mdash;was a regular born "Doubting
Thomas," who nearly always had to be shown,
and seldom believed any statement unless it were
backed up with abundant proof. "Sometimes
there are other beasts abroad in the wild woods
besides the common four-footed kind. I believe
now we've all had our experiences with tramps
and yeggmen of the Weary Willie species. For
one, I'm glad you fetched your gun along, Lil
Artha."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the driver had once more started
the car, and they were moving along the streets
of the home town. Several groups of boys, some
of whom also wore the well-known khaki of the
scouts, called out to them in greeting, and even
waved their hats with a salute. Envious eyes
followed the car as it sped along in a cloud of
dust; for it was pretty generally known that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
lucky five were starting off on a week's camping
trip; and those fellows of the Hickory Ridge
group of Boy Scouts could anticipate a glorious
time ahead for the favored ones.</p>

<p>While the big old seven-passenger touring car,
which the father of Rufus Snodgrass had loaned
them for the occasion, is speeding along, doing
very good time as long as the road is fair, a few
words connected with these lively lads may not
come in amiss.</p>

<p>Elmer Chenowith was the leader of the well-known
Wolf Patrol, and those boys who have had
the good luck to own some of the previous stories
in this series do not need to be told that he was
a capable and resourceful lad, who through his
merits as a first-class scout had received from
Headquarters the privilege of acting as assistant
scout-master, a r&ocirc;le only filled by the most efficient
in a troop.</p>

<p>"Lil Artha" was really Arthur Stansbury.
When he was very young he had been given this
nickname, and even after he suddenly shot up
like a mushroom, so that he now measured a full
head taller than any of his mates, he could not
shake off the ridiculous appellation. People
always smiled when hearing it for the first time;
but then Lil Artha treated the matter as a huge
joke, and often joined in the laugh when the subject
came up.</p>

<p>George Robbins was a pretty good sort of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
chap, only he did worry his chums by his continual
fault finding, and that everlasting desire to
have everything proved before he could "swallow"
it. At one time he had been inclined to be
thin, and a rather poor hand at meal times; but
of late his folks seldom had to ring the dinner
bell twice for George; indeed, as a rule he was
keeping an ear to the ground listening for the
welcome sound.</p>

<p>The other two boys were new members of
Hickory Ridge Troop, and had not as yet progressed
beyond the greenhorn stage. Indeed, it
was partly with the hope that various opportunities
for teaching the "tenderfoot squad"&mdash;as Lil
Artha persisted in calling the pair&mdash;all sorts of
useful knowledge that scouts must sooner or
later acquire, that had induced Elmer to give up
another partly formed plan and consent to
accompany the expedition into the woods.</p>

<p>Rufus Snodgrass was a rather peculiar boy,
taken in all. Elmer believed he had never up to
that time come in contact with just such an odd
fellow. He had been somewhat spoiled by a
doting mamma, though Elmer believed he possessed
many good qualities about him, if only
some revolution could only bring them forward.</p>

<p>In the first place Rufus lacked self-reliance to
a remarkable extent. He could not seem to feel
confidence in himself when some sudden or alarming
emergency arose. On this account he turned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
out to be somewhat of a failure as a baseball
player, for when he saw a high ball driven to
his outfield his heart always sank "to his shoes,"
as he told himself he never could get that fly
in the wide world; and lacking confidence he seldom
did hang on to it.</p>

<p>Elmer had faith to believe he could cure Rufus
of this grievous fault if only he associated with
him in camp for a time. He would show him a
score of things such as go to make good scouts,
and teach him how to "hit the knot squarely in
the centre," when chopping wood, to begin with.</p>

<p>Alec McGregor was a boy who had not been a
great while in America. His folks, needless to
say, hailed from Scotland, and freckle-faced and
red-headed Alec had a delightful little "burr" to
his tones when talking. Like so many of his
kind he was inclined to be a bit pugnacious, and
hot-tempered; still Elmer believed him to be both
warm-hearted, and as true as steel. After he had
been with the scouts a while, and picked up a few
lessons in the broad principles of the craft, the
patrol leader fancied that Alec would prove one
of the smartest members of the troop.</p>

<p>He had a little sister named Jessie at home, a
pretty rosy-cheeked Scotch lassie, who was the
pride of his heart. The boy never tired of chanting
her praises, and often sang ballads, in which
"Sweet Jessie, the Flower of Dumblane," occupied
the leading part. And Alec had a robust tenor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
voice in the bargain, which his mates always
liked to hear when seated about the camp fire.</p>

<p>Now as to their reason for taking this thirty-mile
trip, laden down with tent, camp duffle, edibles
enough for a regiment, and all sorts of
traps in the bargain, so that the car did resemble
a moving van, just as Elmer had remarked when
it stopped at his gate for him to work his way
aboard.</p>

<p>Mr. Snodgrass was a rich man who had latterly
taken up his residence in the town. He had come
into possession of a large tract of land, partly
heavily wooded, and lying up along Raccoon
Bluff, a place the boys had often heard of, but
none of them ever visited.</p>

<p>Now, it seemed that Rufus had just one great
ambition, which was to become a civil engineer
when he grew up. His mother had supplied him
with all the necessary instruments for the calling
of a surveyor, and for several years now Rufus
had associated himself at odd times with some
people engaged in the business, doing very hard
work for a boy of his customary easy habits,
simply because his heart was enlisted in the
game.</p>

<p>He now believed that he could carry out the
lines about a tract of ground as well as the next
one; and upon hearing his father say that he
distrusted the accuracy of a recent survey that
had been given him of the new territory purchased,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Rufus became possessed of an idea which
he was now engaged in carrying out.</p>

<p>His folks had readily given their consent that
he should get several of his scout chums to
accompany him up to Raccoon Ridge, and assist
him to re-survey the ground. Indeed, Mr. Snodgrass,
who was not blind to the failings of his
only son and heir, insisted that he coax Elmer
Chenowith to go along, as a necessary preliminary
to his loaning the big car and also paying
all the expense in the way of provisions.</p>

<p>The real-estate man was a good reader of
human nature, and after hearing all the fine
things that were being said about the Chenowith
boy he took occasion to have a heart-to-heart talk
with Elmer, in which he told the patrol leader
how much he hoped association with a fellow like
him would be worth to Rufus, and actually
begged him to consent to be a member of the
little company.</p>

<p>So that was the way things stood. Rufus, of
course, did not know about this secret understanding
between his father and Elmer; had he
done so he might have rebelled, for he was exceedingly
high-spirited. As it was he felt that
all these good fellows were only keeping him
company because of their love for outdoor life.</p>

<p>It was that sly rascal, George, who had managed
to get possession of the ear of Rufus, and
gain his consent to make out the list of edibles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
they would likely want while away. Which fact
accounted for the "young grocery store," as Lil
Artha termed it, that was taken along. But then,
no healthy boy has ever been known to be dismayed
at a superabundance of good things to
eat; and as Rufus's father did not object to the
size of the bill, none of them felt he really ought
to say a single word.</p>

<p>They made no attempt to speed, for what did
thirty-odd miles amount to when in a car, with
an abundance of gasolene to take one through?
An hour saw them well on their way. Farmhouses
were now becoming "as scarce as hens'
teeth," to quote Lil Artha. As they had not
started until nearly ten in the morning, owing to
various causes, it was now getting well on toward
noon.</p>

<p>"What say we pull up at the next farm-house
we strike, and get dinner, if the good woman of
the place will agree?" asked the driver of the
expedition, who had in the beginning laid down
the law that no one was going to spend one cent
except himself, for his father had insisted on this.</p>

<p>"Suits me, all right," said George, with alacrity.
"You see, I had breakfast pretty early this
morning, and right now I'm feeling about as
empty as Si Hunker's hen-coop was that morning
after the gypsies camped near his place."</p>

<p>Some ten minutes afterwards they found a
wayside farm-house, and the woman, for a consideration,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
agreed to cook dinner for the crowd.
Elmer on his part took occasion to pick up considerable
useful information concerning the
region which generally went under the name of
Raccoon Bluff, possibly because there chanced to
be an unusually large number of those "ring-tailed
varmints" so destructive to corn fields, and
poultry flocks, making their dens in hollow trees
around that vicinity.</p>

<p>Among other things the farmer warned Elmer
to keep an eye out for Jem Shock. The oddity
of the name impressed the boy, and he asked what
there might be about the said Jem to give them
any cause for uneasiness.</p>

<p>"Well, Jem has been a thorn in the flesh of
folks up in this neck of the woods for nigh ten
years now, I guess," was what the tiller of the
soil told him. "He c'n work when he wants to,
but he'd a heap rather loaf, with a gun over his
shoulder. He fishes and hunts out of season.
I've seen him spearing trout, and more'n once
heard how he was known to be taking meat home
in the close season, that couldn't have been sheep
or veal. Besides that, he's a quarrelsome man,
and a desperate character. I wouldn't trust him
out of my sight, for I believe he'd steal from a
camp as quick as anything. But I hope you
don't have any trouble with Jem."</p>

<p>Elmer hoped so, too. At the same time he
found himself wondering whether, after all, some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of those country people might not be judging the
man harshly. Perhaps Jem Shock might not be
such a bad character, on better acquaintance.
And Elmer decided that if the opportunity should
come to him he would take occasion to know the
old poacher at close range, so as to study him
well.</p>

<p>Once more they were on the move, and as this
farm-house would be the last they expected to
run across, all of them were keenly on the lookout
for signs of the ridge which would mark their
arrival at Raccoon Bluff.</p>

<p>They had possibly gone six or seven miles since
eating that glorious farm dinner, when suddenly
as they were passing slowly through a piece of
woodland where the road was a bit soft and wet,
there rang out the nearby report of a rifle,
startling them all, and causing George Robbins
to involuntarily duck his head, as though his
first suspicion was that some one had fired at
them.</p>

<p>Then came a crashing in the bushes, and
across the road sprang a buck, whose antlers
were just reaching their full growth after the
late rutting season.</p>

<p>Never had the boys seen a prettier picture
than when that buck bounded lightly across the
road. Lil Artha mechanically reached out a hand
toward his gun, though, of course, he never
would have thought of using the same while the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
law protected the game. Then the frightened
animal plunged into the thick copse on the opposite
side of the woodland road, and could be heard
bounding swiftly away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE GAME POACHER, JEM SHOCK</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Rufus</span> had involuntarily halted the car at the
very instant the shot was heard, so that the boys
were stationary at the time the deer leaped past
them.</p>

<p>"Oh! what a beaut!" exclaimed George
Robbins.</p>

<p>"The equal of any Scotch stag I ever saw in
the preserves!" echoed Alec, who had stared with
eyes that were round with wonder.</p>

<p>"But somebody shot at him, all the same, don't
you know, and the close season on in the bargain,"
Lil Artha hastened to say, indignantly.</p>

<p>"Hush! here he comes!" observed Elmer.</p>

<p>They all heard a hasty trampling sound, as
though someone might be hurrying through the
bushes close by. It came from exactly the same
quarter from which the alarmed buck had
appeared.</p>

<p>Then a moving figure caught the gaze of the
five scouts. A burly man, roughly dressed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
strode into view. He stared at the car and its
occupants, as though he considered the boys to
be mostly responsible for his recent ill-luck.</p>

<p>"Howdye, mister," sang out Lil Artha, not to
be cowed by angry looks; "are we on the right
road for Raccoon Bluff, would you mind telling
us?"</p>

<p>Suspicion lay in the look which the man was
now bending on them. He acted as if he imagined
they might be more than they seemed; for a
guilty conscience can discover a game warden in
every inoffensive traveler, especially when the
culprit is suddenly caught in the very act of trying
to kill a deer out of season.</p>

<p>"Raccoon Bluff ain't far ahead o' ye, if that's
whar ye happen tuh be headin' fur," he told them
grumblingly; "but might I arsk what yuh a-doin'
away up here in this forsaken kentry?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" Lil Artha told him blithely, "we're off
on a little trip, and mean to spend a week or so
under canvas around this section. You see, the
father of the young fellow at the wheel here,
Rufus Snodgrass, of Hickory Ridge, has lately
come into possession of some property up this
way, and we're going to find out if it's been surveyed
right and proper. If you see our smoke
some time or other, drop in and have a little chin
with us, stranger. We nearly always have the
coffeepot on the fire, and the latch-string is out."</p>

<p>Perhaps the man may have understood this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
sort of a genial invitation, but all the same he
gave no indication of being pleased because of it.
The look of suspicion could still be noticed about
his dark face, and he twisted his rifle about in his
hands kind of nervously, as though he wished he
could keep it from being seen.</p>

<p>"I reckon I ain't a-goin' tuh bother ye much,
strangers," he mumbled. "I got my own business
tuh look arter. Yuh see, I'm the assistant game
warden o' this region, an' it takes a heap o'
trampin' tuh kiver my territory."</p>

<p>With an odd sort of chuckle and grin he nodded
his head toward them, and then whirling on his
heel vanished amidst the scrub. They soon lost
track of his retreating footsteps.</p>

<p>Lil Artha laughed in his peculiar way.</p>

<p>"Huh! smoked the coon out, didn't I? Game
warden, did he call himself? Whoo! to think of
his colossal nerve! I bet you any warden in the
State would give a month's salary to have been
here, and caught him in the act of shooting at a
deer when the law is on."</p>

<p>"Then he was a braw poacher, was he?" burst
from Alec. "Aweel, I can feel for him in a way,
because, to tell you the truth, lads, I've snared
my hare more than a few times across the big
water. But then it's different there, because all
the game country is owned by rich dukes and
lords, and the poor man hasn't any show; while
over here all he has to do is to tramp off into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
wild woods for a couple of days, and take his
chances.</p>

<p>"Elmer, do you think that could have been Jem
Shock?" asked Rufus just then.</p>

<p>The patrol leader showed his surprise, for up
to then he did not know that Rufus had ever
heard that name; at least, the other had kept his
knowledge to himself, for some reason or other.</p>

<p>"I'm pretty sure that's who he is," he told the
boy at the wheel; "but how did you know about
him and his ways; when the farmer only told Lil
Artha and myself?"</p>

<p>Rufus chuckled, and looked wise.</p>

<p>"Oh! I plead guilty," he acknowledged. "I
heard stories about Jem Shock before I left
home, but I wasn't silly enough to pass them
along to the rest of the party, because some of
you might have changed your minds, and found
an excuse for not coming on the trip."</p>

<p>Lil Artha snorted indignantly.</p>

<p>"Now, don't get mad, Lil Artha," said Rufus,
promptly.</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm not riled so much because you kept
your knowledge to yourself, Rufus," the tall scout
told him; "but on account of you thinking Elmer,
George and myself could be shooed off by such
a little thing as that. If you looked back at the
history of the Wolf Patrol you'd find that the
boys belonging to it have all been through a heap
of excitement. We've exposed so-called ghosts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
had adventures with ugly hobo bands, been in
forest fires, fought floods and&mdash;well, time wouldn't
allow me to enumerate one-half of the things that
have befallen us."</p>

<p>"That's enough, Lil Artha," said Elmer, seeking
to soothe the long-legged scout, and pour oil
on the troubled waters. "Rufus will come to
know us better after he's graduated from the
tenderfoot class. But suppose we start on again.
That incident is closed. We may and we may not
see more of Jem Shock. For myself, I'm half
hoping I do, because he's something of a character,
and opens up a new type for a fellow to
study."</p>

<p>"So far as I'm concerned," observed Rufus,
scornfully, "I hope we never run across him
again. He looked like a bad egg to me, and his
eyes had a wicked stare in them, that I didn't
like."</p>

<p>"Oh! that can be easily accounted for," said
Elmer, as the car once more commenced to glide
along the rough woods-road. "You see, in the
first place he had that feeling of guilt that makes
a rascal look at all the rest of the world as his
enemies. Then again I half imagine Jem thinks
the game wardens are back of our coming up to
this neck of the woods."</p>

<p>"Game wardens, Elmer!" exclaimed Alec; "how
could that be, and what would scouts have to do
with the officers of the State?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, scouts seem to have a hand in a good
many things that are connected with keeping the
laws, and making communities live on a higher
standard," the patrol leader explained. "I could
tell you of dozens of things our troop has been
connected with along those lines. And why
shouldn't they enter into an arrangement with
the head warden to get evidence against some of
these guides who kill deer out of season, and
hotel proprietors who offer it to their guests as
'mountain sheep'?"</p>

<p>Alec apparently was a bit puzzled to understand
all this, and so Lil Artha, leaning forward,
took occasion to explain it more fully as they
continued on.</p>

<p>They were passing into an even wilder section
of country than any thus far encountered. Not
a sign of the white man's presence could they see
except in some sections where the original timber
had been cut away years back, and a second
growth now covered the land; with here and there
an old forest monarch left to overtop its neighbors
like a giant looking down on a pigmy host.</p>

<p>"This just suits me to a fraction," Lil Artha
was saying, as they began to ascend what seemed
to be another rise of land. "Why, it's as free
from the restraints of civilization as that Adirondack
region where we went with Toby Jones last
winter, to visit his hermit uncle, Caleb, who was
living all by himself in the heart of the wilderness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
My lands! if only I thought we'd have half as
much fun on this trip as we ran across then, I'd
be happy as a clam at high tide."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we will," Elmer told him. "You
never can tell what's ahead of you when starting
out on one of these trips."</p>

<p>He was thinking at the time of Jem Shock, and
wondering whether the poacher might not take it
into his head to make things interesting for them
during their stay along Raccoon Ridge. Secretly
Elmer was almost hoping he <i>would</i> see something
more of the strange man. He wondered how
Jem lived; what his ambition, providing he had
any, might be; whether he cared for a single
human creature besides himself in all the wide
world&mdash;these and many more thoughts were gripping
Elmer's mind, and he could not shake them
off.</p>

<p>Although, of course, he did not know it at the
time, still it was fated that the golden opportunity
he so eagerly sought was destined to come
his way under conditions of a peculiar nature.
But of that more anon, since it would be hardly
fair to lift the curtain now, and disclose the presence
of coming events long before they were due
to arrive.</p>

<p>"Don't you think this must be the place they call
Raccoon Bluff, Elmer?" asked George just then,
as they continued to climb the rise by means of
the winding road, so seldom used that Rufus had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the greatest difficulty in forcing the car over
exposed roots and outcropping rocks.</p>

<p>"I've been looking around," explained the scout
leader, "and according to what that farmer told
me, I'm sure this is our destination. We can keep
our eyes on the lookout for a suitable camp site
right along now. There'll be plenty of time for
us to get our tent fixed, and a lot of other things
done, before sunset comes."</p>

<p>"Well, we seem to have mounted to the crest of
the bluff, if that's what this rough piece of ground
turns out to be," said Rufus, with a sigh of relief,
for at times he had found it hard work navigating
the rough road, and occasionally he almost feared
they would have to get out and walk the balance
of the way.</p>

<p>A couple of minutes later and Elmer called
out to him to stop the car.</p>

<p>"I think I glimpse a dandy place for a camp
over yonder!" was what the patrol leader remarked
to the others, pointing as he spoke. "And
see what a glorious view we'll have all the time
we're here."</p>

<p>They faced the west, where the sun was heading
toward the horizon, though a good two hours must
elapse before he sank from view. Through openings
in the dense forest they could obtain fine
glimpses of distant parts. It was really as
delightful an outlook as any of the scouts had
ever gazed upon. Alec McGregor, accustomed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
those Scotch mountain views, was loud in his
admiration.</p>

<p>So Rufus brought the car as near the camp site
as was possible, and then all of them leaped out.
Filled with a burning desire to get things started
they proceeded to carry the cargo of the big touring
car across the intervening ground.</p>

<p>Lil Artha, George and the leader held a brief
discussion as to the exact spot that was most suitable
for erecting their waterproof tent, rendered
so through a process of tanning that changed its
color to correspond with their own khaki-hued
garments.</p>

<p>This important detail being finally settled they
began work. Alec and Rufus, being tenderfeet,
of course had to be told about everything they
attempted; but as the spirit of willingness was
strong upon them in the beginning, they carried
out orders cheerfully enough.</p>

<p>Elmer was looking for that inherent weakness
on the part of Rufus to crop out, and sure enough
it came to the surface before they had been a full
hour on the ground. The tent having been properly
set, and a fireplace built after the most approved
scout fashion by Lil Artha, with the two
new fellows taking accurate notes so they could
in turn carry out a similar task, Rufus was set
to work chopping firewood, while Alec had been
given another job connected with making a drain
on the upper side of the tent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is so the water will run aside, and not
flood us out," explained George, who was directing
operations in this quarter. "You see, we may
have a whopping big storm while we're up here,
and again not a drop of rain may fall; but all the
same a true scout gets things ready to meet an
emergency. That's what our motto 'Be Prepared'
stands for. It's a sort of insurance against possible
loss by fire. Your house may never burn
down; in fact, you don't expect it ever will, but
you take out a fire policy all the same, if you're
a wise dicky."</p>

<p>"I get what you are telling me, George," admitted
the shrewd Scotch lad, "and all the while
I'm understanding this scout business better.
There's a muckle mair in it that I used to ken, but
I like the way it turns out; and I'm o'er glad now
I joined the ranks o' the scouts."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Rufus was having his troubles
a-plenty. Evidently he was not very well posted
as to the best way of handling an ax, though he
swung the tool with quite a lusty stroke, Elmer
noticed. For some little time he managed to
smash a certain amount of wood, but finally he
seemed to have run across a section of hard oak
that was giving him a lot of trouble.</p>

<p>He stopped several times to wipe his reeking
forehead with his big red bandanna. Elmer could
see him shake his head as though he felt that he
was up against a hard proposition. For some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
time the scout leader did not interfere. When,
however, he saw Rufus throw the ax down petulantly,
as though determined to give the job up
as a bad bargain, Elmer concluded the moment had
come for him to take a hand in the game and
pilot the tenderfoot through his initial troubles.</p>

<p>As a greenhorn in camp, Rufus must be expected
to do considerable of the fuel getting; and in
order to meet his duties with the least possible
friction and trouble, the sooner he learned how
to handle an ax properly, the better for his peace
of mind. Besides, Elmer did not like to see that
"white flag" business. He disliked a quitter above
all things; and was grimly determined that before
that camp broke up the said Rufus would have
learned a lesson or two that would be profitable
to him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>"HIT THE KNOT AND HIT IT HARD!"</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">How</span> are you coming on, Rufus?" asked Elmer,
pleasantly, as he dropped down on the log alongside
the perspiring chopper.</p>

<p>Rufus laughed, a little unpleasantly, Elmer
thought.</p>

<p>"Oh! I guess I was never cut out for a hewer of
firewood, Elmer," he remarked indifferently.
"Some fellows may take to that sort of thing, but
I incline in the direction of less strenuous employment.
I can fiddle with a surveyor's outfit all day
long, tramp through the woods and the brush, cut
a path, and enjoy it all; but swinging an ax
doesn't seem to be my forte."</p>

<p>"Then if I were you, Rufus," the other told him,
quietly, "I'd shut my teeth together and make it
my forte. I never would let a little thing like that
get the better of me. Why, I couldn't sleep easy
at night if I did."</p>

<p>Rufus moved a little uneasily at that. He undoubtedly
must have guessed that the scout-master<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
meant to reprove him for giving up so soon.
Then he shook his head and frowned.</p>

<p>"Oh! there'll be heaps of other things I <i>can</i>
tackle around the camp, besides playing wood-chopper,
Elmer, that's sure. I've given it a fair
trial, and don't seem to get the hang of the old
thing. Why, it's lucky, I reckon, I didn't smash
my foot. My hands don't seem to tackle the ax
properly. Alec may be better suited to it."</p>

<p>"It isn't hard, once you learn," said Elmer.</p>

<p>"Well, I've given it a try, and I'm ready to call
it off, though I know you don't like to hear that
kind of talk," grumbled Rufus, actually turning
redder than ever with confusion as he felt the
eyes of the other fastened upon his face.</p>

<p>"That's not the spirit in which a scout who has
any respect for himself should act," Elmer told
him, slowly and with a friendly slap on the shoulder.
"Deep down in your heart, Rufus, you just
know that you <i>can</i> master such a little job as
learning how to handle an ax, if only you keep
persistently at it, and never give up. A scout on
being baffled once or twice just sets his teeth
together, takes a fresh grip on himself, and says
he's going to do that thing, no matter if it means
trying sixty-seven times. It's the old maxim of
'Pike's Peak, or Bust,' which the emigrants across
the great plains years ago used to paint on their
wagon-tops. And generally they got there, too,
remember, Rufus."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Elmer got up and took hold of the offending
ax.</p>

<p>"Now, if you watch me you'll see just how I
swing it, and bring it down in the exact spot I
want to strike," he went on to say, after which
he made several strokes and the stubborn piece
of oak that had resisted all the efforts of Rufus
to split it fell into two slabs.</p>

<p>"Well, that was certainly fine," admitted the
boy, wonderingly; "but you're an old hand at it,
Elmer. I'd never be able to do that sort of work."</p>

<p>"Get that notion out of your head in the beginning,
Rufus," he was told, sharply. "There's no
reason in the wide world why you shouldn't make
a good axman, perhaps even better than any of us.
You're strongly built, and can put a heap of muscle
in the work. At first you'll strike poorly, until
you grow accustomed to landing on a given spot.
Practice makes perfect in that particular. And
now, there's one great lesson for you in chopping
wood, just as there is for every beginner. Take
a look at the stick, see which way it will split
easiest; and then if there's a nasty knot in it, as
there was in the one you tackled, strike the blade
of your ax straight into the centre of that knot
<i>again and again</i>, until you succeed in making it
give up the ghost. Hit the knot, Rufus, and hit
hard! That ought to be a maxim you'd find ringing
in your ears every time you feel tempted to
be a quitter!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>That last word stung, just as Elmer meant it
should. Rufus flushed, and jumped to his feet
almost half angrily.</p>

<p>"Here, give me that ax again, Elmer," he said
between his set teeth; "and pick out for me the
toughest old chunk of oak you can find. We'll
see if I'm a <i>quitter</i>. I'll hit the knot, and hit her
hard, to boot; you watch me!"</p>

<p>Elmer hastened to accommodate him. He was
secretly congratulating himself on his success so
early in the game. It chanced that a second fragment
of oak lay near by, and offered a fairly good
test, as it, too, had a difficult knot in its heart.
He showed Rufus just how to take the right sort
of grip on the ax, and several times corrected him
when he struck violently. Of course the blows
lacked much of the accuracy that long practice
gives, and thus considerable energy was wasted;
but after he had been working away for five minutes,
a lucky stroke caused the thick bit of oak to
fall apart. It had been done by keeping up a constant
pounding at the centre of resistance, which
in this case was that tough knot.</p>

<p>Rufus was perspiring, and short of breath after
his exertion, but there was a look of extreme pride
on his flushed face, and his eyes kindled also.
Indeed, there was good reason for his self-congratulation;
he had proven to himself that "where
there is a will there is a way"; and possibly for
the first time in his life Rufus realized the power<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
that one may command when determined not to
give in.</p>

<p>"Well, I did do it, didn't I, Elmer?" he chuckled,
visibly pleased. "And next time I won't be so
ready to throw up the sponge. I was a little bit
huffed because you spoke the way you did, Elmer,
but now I thank you. I wouldn't be surprised but
that I'd have caught that big fly last summer
instead of muffing it, and losing the game for our
side, if only I'd made up my mind I <i>could</i> hold it,
and must."</p>

<p>"That's the ticket, Rufus," the other told him.
"Confidence is half the battle, and the rest is in
doing it. But you've chopped enough for a while;
better change work and give some other set of
muscles a chance to get busy."</p>

<p>"Now, that isn't a bad idea, either, Elmer,"
Rufus went on to say. "I'd like to take a little
turn out of camp before evening comes on, because
somehow I seem to have a sneaking notion
we'll run across one of the survey lines close by
here. You see, they run down from the bluff
across that wide stretch of country toward the
setting sun; and by pushing along the ridge we
ought to find a slashing."</p>

<p>"Well, if you can coax George, here, to go with
you, Rufus," the patrol leader remarked, "I've
no objections. I can understand how eager you
must be to get your location fixed in the start;
and I expect you'll sleep easier tonight if you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
learn that our camp happens to be near one of the
survey lines."</p>

<p>George upon being appealed to readily agreed
to go with the greenhorn. He knew why Elmer
had made this arrangement; for as Rufus was
quite a novice in most things pertaining to woodcraft,
the chances were he would get lost the first
thing. If given an opportunity, George, as a
first-class scout, could begin the education of the
tenderfoot thus placed in his charge; and the first
lesson would be upon various methods of learning
how to make his way through the densest forest
when caught without a compass, and unable even
to see the sun so as to know east from the west,
the north from the south.</p>

<p>So George took great pride in explaining how
the moss on the trees would serve as an almost
infallible guide, all else failing.</p>

<p>"You see, in this section of country nearly all
the big storms come from the southwest," he told
Rufus as they walked on. "The moss is almost
always on the north side of the trees, veering just
a little toward northeast. Notice that fact well,
Rufus, and never forget it. Some time it may
save you heaps of trouble; I know it has me, and
lots of other scouts in the bargain."</p>

<p>Finding that the tenderfoot seemed to show considerable
interest, George went on to tell of other
facts connected with the important subject.</p>

<p>"Now," he observed, soberly, "you may think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
I'm going to a lot of trouble telling you all this,
Rufus; but if ever you do get lost in the woods,
and keep wandering around for hours, and then
have to make a lonely camp, and sit up most of
the night listening to the owls and foxes and such
things, why, you'll understand why it's so important
a thing in the education of a scout."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lil Artha and Alec were trying their
hands at the woodpile; for as the elongated scout
explained to the Scotch lad, they would have need
of considerable fuel during the long evening, as
they sat by their fire and talked.</p>

<p>Alec proved to have enough stamina, at least;
there was a stubborn streak in his Scotch blood
that would never allow him to give up easily.
Nevertheless, Lil Artha knew Alec had faults that
must be corrected before he could reach that condition
of excellence that all true scouts aspire
to attain.</p>

<p>He had a hasty temper, like most red-haired,
impulsive boys, and was, moreover, a little inclined
to be cruel, especially toward dumb animals.
Lil Artha, himself, had once been the same
sort of a chap, and could readily sympathize with
Alec; but at that he meant the other should see
the error of his ways, and reform. So the tall
member of the Wolf Patrol took it upon himself
to be a mentor; and who so well fitted for the
task as a boy who had had personal experience?
No one can preach temperance so splendidly as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the man who, himself, has passed through the
fire of unbridled passions, and learned the folly of
giving way to them.</p>

<p>Alec was particularly interested in the subject
of the reversal of his badge. He had, of course,
followed the customary habit of all scouts by fastening
this to his coat in the morning in an upside-down
position, until he found some opportunity
for doing a good deed toward some one, which act
allowed him to change its position.</p>

<p>"That was easy enough at home, d'ye mind,
Lil Artha," he was saying, as he rested upon his
ax, and recovered his breath, "because a fellow
would be a gillie if he couldnae find mony a chance
to do something for sae sweet a bairn as our little
Jessie. But it's going to be a harder task away
up here in the wilderness, I trow."</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't know about that, Alec," the other
told him, encouragingly. "All you have to do is
to keep your eyes about you. There are four
chums around, and if at any time, for instance,
you took a notion to do my stint of wood-chopping,
that ought to entitle you to turn your badge
over, because it would be a good deed, you see."</p>

<p>Alec looked queerly at him, and then laughed.</p>

<p>"But it would be depriving you of your necessary
exercise, Lil Artha," he hastened to say, "and
that I'd hate to do."</p>

<p>"Well, seriously speaking then, Alec, there are
endless ways of doing good. You needn't be confined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
to lending a helping hand to human beings;
a boy who takes a stone out of the shoe of a limping
mule is just as much a benefactor as the one
who helps a poor old woman across a crowded
street, or carries her heavy basket part of the way
home from market. I've bound up the broken
wing of a crow; yes, and I knew a scout who even
helped one of those queer little tumble-bugs get
his ball up a little rise, after he'd watched him
fall back a dozen times, and then claim the right
to alter his badge. The rest of the troop laughed
at him, but the scout-master hushed them up, and
said the boy was right; and that not only had he
done a good deed toward one of the humblest of
created things, but he had learned a practical
lesson in pertinacity and never-give-upitiveness
that would be of great value to him all the rest
of his life."</p>

<p>"Nae doot, nae doot," muttered the Scotch lad,
reflectively, as though Lil Artha's interesting
words had found a firm lodgment in his heart.
"I can see where it is a verra interesting subject,
this scoutcraft, Lil Artha. And ye ken I'm mair
than glad now I took up with it."</p>

<p>"And as you get to be more intimate with the
little animals of the woods," continued the experienced
scout, "you come to like them as brothers.
We usually have a pet squirrel ducking about the
camp, picking up the crumbs; and birds will come,
too, if you're kind to them. All those little things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
help to make an outing more enjoyable, you'll find,
Alec, the deeper you dip into them."</p>

<p>Alec scratched his head as though he found it
just a little difficult to understand; he had been
raised under such vastly different conditions that
it would take some time to change his habits, Lil
Artha realized. Still, he liked the tenderfoot very
much, and meant to do all he could to make him
see things through another pair of spectacles than
those he had used in the past.</p>

<p>Already his lessons in handling the ax had
borne fruit, and Alec gave promise of soon becoming
an expert at the job. His success also gave
the greenhorn a new-born ambition to excel in
other branches of scout education. Lil Artha did
not believe he would have much trouble in posting
Alec; getting him to govern his temper, and
be kind to everything that had life, would be
another proposition; but constant association
with such a fellow as Elmer Chenowith was bound
to work a change little short of miraculous, Lil
Artha had faith to believe; for he knew personally
what the patrol leader was able to accomplish in
his quiet, persistent way.</p>

<p>"After you've finished with that log, Alec," he
told the other, "we'll start our fire. I want to
show you just how to go about that task, because
there are a hundred things connected with making
a fire that you'll find mighty interesting."</p>

<p>"Ye don't say, Lil Artha? I didna ken that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
there was more than one way to start a blaze,
which was to sticket a match to the paper, and let
it go at that."</p>

<p>The tall scout laughed delightedly. Really, he
would find great pleasure in showing this greenhorn
how many curious ways there were of starting
a fire. Lil Artha had made this a sort of fad
for some time past; and while several tricks were
still beyond his comprehension, he had mastered
a number of others; so that he could start into the
woods minus a single match, or even a burning
sun glass, and make a fire in any one of five different
ways.</p>

<p>"Oh! I can see where you've got a whole lot
to learn, Alec," he told the other. "I'll promise
to show you some interesting things while we're
up here in the Raccoon Bluff camp. For instance,
I'll make a blaze by rubbing flint and steel
together, like the old Indians used to do centuries
back on this continent. Then I've a little trick
with a couple of sticks and some dry tinder to
catch the spark."</p>

<p>"Ye maun show me that, for a certainty!" cried
the other, "because I've read of it in Robinson
Crusoe, or some ither book of travel and adventure
amang the islands of the sea."</p>

<p>"Oh! there are lots of other ways for doing it
in the bargain," pursued Lil Artha, now upon his
most favored subject. "You'll think it a most
fascinating thing, Alec, I promise you. And once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
you wake up to the fact that a scout can learn
a thousand facts, if only he uses his eyes and his
head, you'll be more than glad you joined the
troop. Why, we live in a world of our own, and
the poor ninnies outside don't have one-tenth of
the fun that falls to us."</p>

<p>"There come Rufus and George," remarked
Alec. "They look unco' pleased, as if they had
discovered the slashing they went to look for. I'm
a little interested in survey work mysel'. Rufus
is clean crazy over it, too, and sometimes his
fash is all aboot theodolites and chains and compasses
and the like. They told me he was lazy,
but if ye seed him workin' at the business he
loved, ye'd know they leed, they leed."</p>

<p>Alec turned back to his work of splitting the
log he had attacked. Already he had a wedge
well driven into its heart. A few more lusty
blows of the ax and he had opened another cleft
further along, into which he was able, with Lil
Artha's directions, to place a second wedge.
After that it was easy to continue lengthening the
split until with a doleful crack the log fell apart,
having been cleft in twain.</p>

<p>"That will do for now, Alec," said Lil Artha.
"You have done splendidly for your first real lesson
in wood-chopping, and I can see with half an
eye that you bid fair to beat us all at the game,
given a little time, and more experience. You've
got a great swing, and seem able to hit a space the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
size of a dime, every time you let fall. That's
half of the battle in chopping, to be able to drive
true to the mark; because there's energy wasted
in false blows."</p>

<p>Alec looked pleased. A little praise judiciously
bestowed is always a great accelerator in coaxing
reluctant boys to take up their tasks cheerfully;
and wise Lil Artha knew it.</p>

<p>Just then Alec happened to catch a glimpse of
something moving amidst the branches of the tree
over his head. Lil Artha had turned aside, and
did not chance to notice what the other was doing,
as the Scotch lad, stooping down, snatched up a
stout cudgel, and hastily threw it aloft.</p>

<p>His aim must have been excellent, judging from
the immediate results. Lil Artha heard him give
a satisfied cry, which, however, almost immediately
changed to a howl of alarm. Whirling
around, the tall scout saw something that might
have amused him at another time, for it possessed
the elements of comedy rather than tragedy.</p>

<p>Alec in hurling that stick aloft must have succeeded
in dislodging some animal from its hold
on the limb. The beast in falling had alighted
fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the astonished
Scotch boy, and given him a severe case of
fright. Lil Artha saw that it possessed a long
ringed tail, and hence he knew instantly that it
was only a harmless raccoon, and not a fierce
wildcat, as he had at first feared.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SHOWING THE GREENHORNS</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Whoo!</span> tak' him off, Lil Artha! It's a mad
cat, it is, I'm thinkin'!"</p>

<p>The 'coon being presently dislodged, after having
only given Alec a few trifling scratches, proceeded
to retreat in hot haste. The angry Scotch
lad, snatching up another billet of wood, was
about to rush after the frightened animal as
though to vent his fury upon it, when Lil Artha
barred the way.</p>

<p>"Don't do it, Alec!" he called out, holding up a
restraining hand; "let the poor thing trot along.
He's more scared than you were, take it from me."</p>

<p>"But he <i>bit</i> me, ye ken; and I don't let any fearsome
wild beastie do that with impunity, I tell
ye!" snapped Alec.</p>

<p>"Well, who's really to blame, Alec?" said Lil
Artha, promptly. "That's only a harmless raccoon.
He must have his nest in a hollow limb
of this tree we're under. Hearing all the talk
going on below here, can you blame him for peeking,
and trying to pick up a few points about eating,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and the like? He was within his rights, and
you had no business to knock him down with that
chunk of wood. He happened to fall on your
shoulders, and commenced scratching and clawing
when you jabbed at him so with your hands. He
only scratched you a little, and drew the blood.
Elmer has the stuff to put on that, and prevent
any chance of blood poisoning setting in. But
surely you wouldn't kill that inoffensive little runt
because he allowed you to knock him out of the
tree."</p>

<p>Alec hung his head.</p>

<p>"Aweel, it may be you're right, Lil Artha," he
muttered, being conquered by the arguments advanced
by the other. "Anyway, it's too late now
to chase after him, for the beastie is lang out of
sight. Perhaps I was o'er hasty to throw. Next
time I'll try to hold my hand."</p>

<p>"It pays not to be too fast while in the woods,"
he was assured. "If now that had happened to
be a bobcat, you'd have been in a nice pickle, let
me tell you; and he might have scratched out both
your eyes before the rest of us could lift a hand
to save you. Better go slow but sure, Alec. And
try to look at things once in a while from the
standpoint of the woods animal. You'll find it
mighty interesting to put yourself in their place,
and figure just what you would do."</p>

<p>Again Alec scratched that tousled red head of
his. Plainly he was puzzled to exactly grasp what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Lil Artha meant; but then, as time passed and he
became more accustomed to this strange camp
life, now so new to him, the boy would doubtless
understand many things that in the beginning
looked very mysterious.</p>

<p>When, a short time later, Lil Artha began to
initiate him into the mysteries of fire-making,
Alec displayed more or less fresh interest. He
knew he was going to like that sort of thing first-rate,
he told the other; which acknowledgment
caused the tall scout to grin with pleasure, since
it repaid him tenfold for all the trouble he had
taken thus far.</p>

<p>The fire was soon burning cheerily. Somehow
it seemed a great source of joy to everyone, especially
Elmer, Lil Artha and George. As veteran
scouts the crackle of a blaze instantly called up
fond memories of numerous former occasions
when in the woods, and camping amidst the solitudes
they had met with all sorts of interesting
and even thrilling adventures, never to be utterly
forgotten, even when they had grown to manhood,
and gone forth into the world upon their appointed
life missions.</p>

<p>Next in order came the preparations for cooking
the camp supper. Here Lil Artha had fresh
and glorious opportunities to show the tenderfoot
squad all sorts of things that it was of prime
importance they should early manage to acquire,
if they expected to make good scouts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>And when the ham had been nicely browned in
the skillet; the potatoes and onions thoroughly
cooked; the coffee allowed to settle, after being
brought to a boil; and the rudely-built table set
with all sorts of good things besides, from cookies,
jam, home-made pies, pickles, and such articles
as the crafty George had prevailed upon his dupe,
Rufus, to include in the bulky stores, it seemed as
though there was hardly room to allow their
plates a chance to find crevices for lodgment.</p>

<p>By this time the sun had set in a blaze of glory
that called forth loud words of sincere admiration
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'for'">from</ins> the entire party. Twilight was upon the land
as they sat down to enjoy that glorious spread;
and both Rufus and Alec vowed they had never
in all their lives felt one-half so hungry as right
then and there.</p>

<p>That supper would never be forgotten by those
tenderfoot scouts. Every fellow once new to the
woods can look back to the first meal under such
conditions, and remember how wonderfully good
everything did taste. The food at home never had
such tempting qualities, and his one great fear
was that the supply would not be equal to the
<i>enormous</i> demand.</p>

<p>After supper came the dish washing. That was
not quite so fine, especially since Rufus and Alec
had fairly gorged themselves. But Elmer knew
that it was good to start out right.</p>

<p>"Oh! what's the use bothering with the old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
dishes tonight?" complained Rufus, spoiled at
home by a doting mother; "I'm feeling too fine to
be disturbed. Please don't spoil it all by doing
anything disagreeable, Elmer."</p>

<p>His wheedling tone had no effect. The scout-master
was determined that these two new recruits
must learn that duty always precedes
pleasure with a scout. After all work has been
finished is the proper time to "loaf," and take
things easy.</p>

<p>"We have a rule in camp that is as unbending
as that of the Medes and the Persians, Rufus,"
Elmer went on to say, positively. "That is, the
dishes must be cleaned up immediately after supper,
by those who are delegated with the task. I'll
be only too glad to show you and Alec how to go
about it, in case you haven't had any experience;
but the pot of hot water is waiting, and none of
us can settle down to an evening's enjoyment
until things are cleared away. All of us mean to
take our turns at the job, remember, but we
thought the new beginners ought to be the ones to
start first."</p>

<p>Rufus looked as though inclined to rebel. Just
then Alec jumped up, being more ready to give in
than the boy who had always had his own way.</p>

<p>"Coom alang, Rufus, and we'll wrestle with the
pots and pans!" he called out. "Between the
baith of us we should be able to manage, I ken.
And then for a lang evenin' listenin' to the stories<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Lil Artha, here, has promised to spin, that will,
nae doot, mak' Robert Louie Stevenson's wildest
tales tak' a back seat."</p>

<p>Well, after that Rufus could not hold out. He
even grinned sheepishly a bit as he got up from
his comfortable position, and followed the Scotch
lad and Elmer over to where the dishpan was
hung on a convenient nail, together with a supply
of towels, and several dish cloths, all seen to by
Lil Artha, who knew by long experience how
necessary such things are in a well conducted
camp.</p>

<p>So by slow degrees Elmer and his mates might
make progress in educating the tenderfoot squad
along the lines that every well drilled scout has
to follow. Of course they would meet with many
discouragements, and sometimes feel that the task
was beyond their strength, especially in connection
with Rufus, who had allowed such a multitude
of tares to grow amidst the good seed that
would have to be rooted out; but it is astonishing
how much persistence and patience will accomplish,
and in the end surprising results might
reward the laborers in the vineyard.</p>

<p>They sat up late that night and the fire continued
to crackle merrily as fresh fuel was applied
from time to time. How wonderful it all seemed
to Rufus and Alec, experiencing their very first
night in camp. The moon had already set, being
young, and darkness hung over the scene.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Strange sounds, too, welled up out of that gloom
to thrill the greenhorns as they listened. Again
and again did one of them interrupt the conversation
or the story-telling to demand that some
fellow tell what manner of queer creature could
be making such and such a noise.</p>

<p>Now it was some night bird giving a hoarse
cry; again a distant loon, doubtless out upon some
lake, the presence of which they had not even
suspected, sent forth a fiendish sound like the
laugh of an evil sprite and which chilled the blood
in the veins of the tenderfoot scouts; later on they
heard tree frogs commence their weird chorus,
and were relieved to learn the nature of the noisy
sounds, for they half suspected a circle of ravenous
wolves might be closing in around the camp.</p>

<p>And so it went on, one thing after another.
Perhaps the most singular effect of all was produced
by the hooting of a big owl, doubtless
squatted in some dead treetop within a few hundred
yards of the fire. The two greenhorns really
believed some man was calling out and making
fun of them. Rufus, on his part, jumped to the
conclusion that the poacher, possibly under the
influence of liquor, was daring them to come out
and have a fight with him, for that tantalizing
"whoo! whoo!" seemed to breathe defiance and
scorn. Alec, too, showed symptoms of "firing
up," much to the secret amusement of Lil Artha
and George.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>They both quieted down after being told what
sort of a big-eyed bird was responsible for the
weird noise; though from time to time as the
hoots continued to be wafted to them on the night
air, the tenderfoot scouts would move uneasily,
and exhibit fresh traces of interest bordering on
rank incredulity, since it was difficult for them to
really believe any feathered creature could indulge
in such a mocking monologue.</p>

<p>And later still, after they had crept into their
warm blankets, and sought to go to sleep, while
the three veterans after a while managed to find
forgetfulness in honest slumber, the other pair
tossed back and forth, changed their hemlock-filled
pillows into new positions, sighed dismally,
and put in one of the most trying nights they had
ever known.</p>

<p>But then it would not be so bad on the next
occasion; and before many nights passed they,
too, would be "dead to the world a short time after
hitting the hay," as Lil Artha expressed it.
Every fellow has to be broken in before he can
sleep, when camping out for the first time; the
great wilderness around seems peopled with
countless unseen, but nevertheless present, creatures,
which his lively imagination pictures as
seeking to steal a march upon the camp, and
either to purloin all their possessions or else eat
them alive.</p>

<p>Why, even experienced campers usually have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
a poor first night of it, until they can again grow
accustomed to the difference between their own
soft beds within the four walls of home, and this
canvas covering, or perhaps only the starry
heavens above for a canopy.</p>

<p>That long night seemed never to reach an end,
to Rufus at least; for even after the Scotch lad
had passed into slumberland the other squirmed
about uneasily, sat up and looked around him
many times; and even crept out twice to throw
additional fuel on the fire, because he hated to see
it getting so dismally dark around, with all those
queer sounds welling up in chorus&mdash;the said
chorus being produced in part, if Rufus only
knew it, which he didn't, by katydids, crickets,
tree-frogs, and such harmless little creatures.</p>

<p>But even the longest night must come to an end
at last. Rufus, having finally fallen into a doze,
found himself aroused by some one talking, and
opening his eyes discovered to his surprise that it
was broad daylight, with breakfast cooking near
by.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE SPIRAL OF BLUE SMOKE</div>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> thing, at least, pleased Rufus when he
crawled forth and stretched himself, giving a
yawn at the same time&mdash;it promised to be a fine
day. To a fellow who expected to do considerable
prowling around in the vicinity of Raccoon Bluff
this was a matter of material importance; for a
heavy rain must have put a damper on his cherished
plans.</p>

<p>By the time the latest up had finished dressing
the welcome call to breakfast was sounding. Lil
Artha performed this sacred rite, and in the customary
camp way, wishing to initiate the two
tenderfoot chums in all the mysteries that went
with the ceremony. Taking the biggest frying-pan
they had fetched along, he rattled a lively
tattoo upon it with a heavy cooking spoon. And
during the course of their stay it may be said in
passing that never was there a more eagerly anticipated
racket, in the opinion of Rufus and Alec,
when their camp appetites developed, than that
same summons to the "festive board," as Lil
Artha dubbed the rude makeshift table.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>While they enjoyed the fruits of the cook's skill
in wrestling with the culinary outfit, and made
the bacon and fried eggs vanish in a most remarkably
swift fashion, the boys also laid out their
plans for the first day.</p>

<p>Of course Rufus was eager to get busy looking
up the lines of the survey; and he had already
bound Alec to the task of being his helper. The
latter did not object in the least, though after a
day or two had elapsed, and the fever calmed
down somewhat with Rufus, the Scotch lad anticipated
having his time more to himself; for he
was eager to learn a great many scout secrets
which the accommodating lanky Lil Artha had
promised to <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'import'">impart</ins> to the new fellows.</p>

<p>Elmer, however, had no intention of allowing
those two greenhorns free swing for a whole day.
The chances were ten to one they would get lost
the first thing; and it would be too bad if a good
part of their limited stay at Raccoon Bluff was
taken up in hunting missing comrades.</p>

<p>"I appoint you, Lil Artha, as supervisor," he
went on to say, with a smile; "and your duties
today will be to stick to Rufus and Alec like a
porous plaster. Don't let one of them get out of
your sight for a minute. You can lend a hand as
much as you please; and fetch them back to camp
at midday, when we'll have lunch, leaving the big
meal until the day's work is all done."</p>

<p>Rufus looked as though about to rebel. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
was so accustomed to having his own way that
it came hard with him to be ordered to do anything.
Then he suddenly remembered his scout
vow, and that he had solemnly promised to bow
to superior authority. Elmer was the "boss," and
his word was law while they were away from
home; so, making a virtue of necessity, Rufus
shrugged his shoulders and grinned.</p>

<p>"Just as you say, Elmer," he observed, a bit
ungraciously, "but I never was lost in all my life."</p>

<p>"That's nothing to boast of, Rufus," remarked
Lil Artha. "It only goes to prove how many
splendid opportunities you've missed. On my
part I was just as proud of my ability to look
after myself as you are; and yet I used to get
twisted in my bearings a heap until I got the
hang of things. I can remember several times
when I walked straight away from camp, under
the belief that I was heading for it. You see,
while I could easily tell which was north and east,
I didn't know <i>which way the camp lay</i>; because
my faculty for observation hadn't yet been developed
to any great extent. It'll all come to you
by degrees, if you really want to learn."</p>

<p>"Well, what am I to do this morning, Elmer?"
asked George.</p>

<p>"That's an easy one," chuckled the leader. "As
you're such a stickler for having everything so
neat about the camp, George, with things handy
to the reach, I'll appoint you camp warden for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
today. You can fuss around all you please, and
by night I expect we'll find that Camp Comfort
well deserves its name."</p>

<p>George looked pleased. His good qualities
often more than counterbalanced his poor ones;
and being neat is something no scout should ever
feel ashamed of.</p>

<p>Elmer did not mention what he meant to do
himself. In fact, he had not wholly determined
that point, though he fancied that he might take
a wide turn around, and see what the country
about Raccoon Bluff looked like.</p>

<p>Although Elmer had not said anything about it
to the others, the fact is he had made a little discovery
that aroused his interest considerably.
Just before they sat down to breakfast he had
chanced to step over to a point where the best
view was to be had, and using a pair of field-glasses
which had been brought along, took a
casual survey of the country.</p>

<p>In one particular spot he believed he could see
a faint column of pale blue smoke climbing
straight skyward from amidst the thick growth.
Elmer was a pretty good woodsman, and he did
not have to be told that such smoke always comes
from well seasoned wood, while black smoke
springs from greener stuff.</p>

<p>Some one had a fire over there, that was evident,
and knew what sort of fuel to select in the
bargain; which fact made it patent that he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
educated in the ways of the woods. Elmer's curiosity
was excited. He wondered who their neighbor
could be. Was it some fishing party, perhaps
camped on the shore of the unseen lake on the
bosom of which that loon they had heard cry had
been swimming at the time?</p>

<p>Of course there might be numerous answers
to the question Elmer was asking himself. Perhaps
lumbermen were looking over the property
which had lately come into the possession of Mr.
Snodgrass, with an idea of making him a proposition
for the right to cut off the big timber. Then
again, charcoal-burners sometimes worked in the
season; or it might be game wardens were
abroad, with the idea of catching detested poachers
at their work.</p>

<p>Then last of all Elmer thought of Jem Shock,
the slippery customer whom no warden had thus
far been able to catch red-handed, breaking the
game laws; and who, it seemed, had gained an
unenviable reputation for boldness as well as
knavery, so that his name, bandied about from lip
to lip, had gradually become a synonym for everything
that was bad, whether the fellow deserved
it or not.</p>

<p>Well, they knew that this same Jem lived somewhere
in the wilderness, since he seldom appeared
in any town; and what more likely than that his
camp lay over yonder, where the blue trail of
smoke lifted toward the sky?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Elmer felt an enticing temptation beginning to
assail him. It has been said before that he had
found himself attracted toward Jem Shock, simply
because of a curiosity to know what the <i>real</i>
man might be like; for Elmer was loath to believe
all he heard about any one, knowing how stories
are magnified in the telling.</p>

<p>And by the time breakfast was over with, the
scout leader had decided that he would take a
little stroll, which might, there was no telling,
carry him in the direction of the blue column of
smoke.</p>

<p>It happened that Rufus was so busy getting
ready to start out with his surveying instruments
that he had given no thought to looking around.
Lil Artha on his part would, of course, take note
of the general lay of the land; but with the ridge
to serve as a guide he believed he could always
make a bee-line back to camp whenever the necessity
arose.</p>

<p>All was soon ready, and Alec, laden with the
heavier material, called out a cheery goodbye to
the two who were being left behind.</p>

<p>"I'm glad this day that I've got on the braw
khaki breeks," he was saying, "for if they were
woollen ye maun rest assured it would tak all my
time picking off the beggars' lice, as ye call these
little burrs. We'll be back the noo and expectin'
lunch to be served, George, remember, lad."</p>

<p>"Well, stick by Lil Artha then, if you know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
what's good for you, Scotchy," called out the
keeper of the camp. "And I'm glad Elmer made
each one of you put a little snack of cheese and
crackers in his pocket. If you have the misfortune
to get lost that will be the only thing to stand
between you and starvation."</p>

<p>Rufus sniffed in disdain.</p>

<p>"Talk away, George," he told the other, "we all
know that you're one of these pessimists, and
always seeing the black side of things. Who expects
to get lost? Certainly neither of us. And
besides, what do we have a guardian angel like
Lil Artha along with us for? Not because of his
good looks, that's sure."</p>

<p>"Oh! come along, and don't talk so much,
Rufus!" the said "guardian angel" called out,
though smiling broadly at being so highly complimented.</p>

<p>"Just see Lil Artha feeling of his shoulders,
will you?" George jeered. "Now you've gone and
spoiled him for any decent sort of work, Rufus;
after this he'll be spending most of his time looking
for his angel wings to sprout. But goodbye,
and good luck, fellows. Look for you about noon,
remember."</p>

<p>So they went off, seemingly as happy as boys
could well be; for Rufus was about to test his
superior knowledge of survey work. Alec saw a
chance of having many little talks between whiles
with the tall guide, upon whom he was leaning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
more and more as an exponent of the jolly times
to be had in the open; while Lil Artha, himself,
was always supremely happy when he could
shoulder his Marlin gun, and stalk abroad, no
matter whether he meant to do any hunting or
not.</p>

<p>Elmer knew very well that nothing would tempt
Lil Artha to fire his gun with the intention of
breaking the law. The only reasons he insisted on
taking it along were that it might come in handy
in case they met a wildcat, always a possibility,
of course; and that he loved to feel its familiar
touch upon his shoulder, where his khaki coat
was well worn from contact with it.</p>

<p>For some little time afterwards Elmer busied
himself in fixing certain things of his own. George
had already cleaned up the mess of breakfast
pans and dishes, so that he could devote himself
to other matters. He had already sized things
up, and made a list of certain improvements that
were calculated to add to the comfort and peace
of mind of the campers.</p>

<p>"While we're only going to be up here at Raccoon
Bluff for a matter of seven days or so," he
had remarked in the hearing of the tenderfoot
squad, "that's no reason we ought to let things
run along in a slipshod fashion. It's a pleasure
to me to have the camp look spic and span to begin
with, no matter if it does get littered up somewhat
as the days go by."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>That is just the way with scouts, as a rule.
No one of them unites all the virtues in his single
person; but while owning up to certain faults, at
the same time he will be found to possess a number
of splendid qualities that add to the comfort
and health of his comrades. George could make
himself one of the most disagreeable chaps going,
when his argumentative and unbelieving mood
was upon him; then again, he would suddenly
blossom out in another phase, and cause all his
chums to bless him as a real public benefactor.</p>

<p>Finally Elmer strode forth from the tent.</p>

<p>"I'm going to take a little turn around, George,"
he remarked casually, "and see what this part of
the country looks like."</p>

<p>"All right, Elmer," the busy one told him, "I
can manage alone, I guess, because I've got a
heap to do before I'm satisfied with the way
things look. No use telling <i>you</i> to not get lost;
because that'd be next to impossible."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," the scout-master assured him,
"I mean to keep on the alert, for when you're in
the woods constant vigilance is the price of safety.
I always take observations as I go along; and
notice many queer-shaped trees, so that I'll know
them again when I see them. I also look back
considerably, too, because it pays to notice how
things appear from the other side."</p>

<p>"It certainly does," agreed George, very amiably;
"I've had that experience myself more than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
once. Thought I had taken stock of bent-over
trees and rock formations, yet on trying to follow
the trail back, they all looked vastly different
from what they had before. Taught me a lesson
I've never forgotten either. Well, so-long,
Elmer. I'll expect you when you turn up. I hope
though you don't happen to run foul of that ugly
poacher chap, Jem Shock. I didn't much fancy
the cut of his jib when we met him on the road;
and I reckon he'd be a bad one to rile up."</p>

<p>Elmer only laughed lightly and walked off.
He had cut a stout cane, and this was the only
kind of weapon he cared to carry along. It would
serve him in good stead should he happen to come
across a rattlesnake, for this was likely to happen
at any time, since they had been warned by the
friendly farmer that such venomous reptiles
abounded along Raccoon Bluff. And in case a
bobcat should turn up, Elmer fancied he could
defend himself against attack with that choice
staff. Besides, it was not often that a cat was
to be met with in broad daylight, since they prefer
to do most of their wandering about in search
of food after nightfall comes.</p>

<p>He stopped and looked back at the camp. It
had a very picturesque appearance just at that
time, with the fire casting up a spiral of smoke
toward the clear heavens, George bustling around
in the capacity of campkeeper; and the whole
overhung by those magnificent trees.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Elmer dearly loved this sort of thing. Something
implanted in his nature, coming down possibly
from far-back ancestors who used to hunt
game for a living, caused the boy to possess an
earnest yearning to spend a season every year
in the primeval wilderness, close to Nature's
heart. It was as near the "call of the wild" as
the ordinary boy ever gets, since school duties,
as well as home ties, have dominion over him
most of the year.</p>

<p>Elmer prepared to enjoy himself to the full.
The air was certainly delicious at this time in
the morning, though growing rapidly warmer as
the sun climbed higher. All outdoors seemed to
be rejoicing with him. He could hear the merry
voices of insects all around; the croaking of frogs
in a nearby marshy spot he passed; and the constant
cawing of crows in the treetops, as they
prepared to sally forth bent on finding a late
breakfast, or possibly teaching their young how
to use their wings in short flights around the home
nests.</p>

<p>"This is the life!" said Elmer, exultingly, as
he walked along with a brisk step, and used his
eyes to notice a thousand and one things around
him, most of which would of a certainty never be
seen at all by an ordinary boy, until his senses
had been sharpened, brought about through practical
scout activities.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A LITTLE WOODS MINSTREL</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Nothing</span> seemed to escape the trained eyes of
the scout-master, as he walked on through the
woods, across open glades, and sometimes crossing
ravines where little brooks gurgled along in
a happy care-free fashion, after the habit of wandering
streamlets in general.</p>

<p>One of the first things that came to his attention
was the unusual number of wild bees that
seemed to be working in the flowers that dotted
some of these open places. This interested Elmer
very much; and as he stopped to watch them going
in and out of the flowers, busily adding to
their stores of sweets or pollen, he was rubbing
his chin reflectively while saying to himself:</p>

<p>"It looks as if there might be a hive or so
around this region, away up in some hollow tree.
I'd like mighty well to spend a morning trying to
locate it, and if nothing hinders I'll get one of
the boys to help me track these little chaps to their
hiding-place. I've done it before, and ought to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
be able to again, if I haven't forgotten the trick
that old woodsman showed me. And I should
think Alec, perhaps Rufus in the bargain, would
be pleased to see how the thing is done."</p>

<p>Then as he went on a little further he discovered
small tracks, plainly outlined in the hardening
mud alongside one of the streams that trickled
down toward the lower levels.</p>

<p>"Hello! good morning, Mr. Mink!" said Elmer,
as he bent over to examine the tracks which he
easily guessed were made by the fur-bearing animal
he had mentioned. "Been out late for a stroll,
haven't you? Visiting around, perhaps, to see
how your relatives are getting on; and dodging
in and out of all these holes along the bank. Well,
all I can hope is that no bad trapper covets your
sleek coat, and lies in wait for you next winter
with his sharp-edged steel trap."</p>

<p>Next he discovered another track quite different
in design.</p>

<p>"Why, how do you do, Brother Fox?" Elmer
chattered, amusing himself by this manner of
monologue, just as though the animal might be
within sound of his voice. "You were also abroad
during the night, I see, and carrying home some
sort of game in the bargain, for the little foxes in
the den, judging from the scratches alongside
your own tracks. Let's see if I can find out what
it was you managed to grab."</p>

<p>He followed the trail fully fifty yards before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
making any discovery. Then the observant boy
triumphantly snatched something up from the
ground.</p>

<p>"A fine, fat young partridge, I wager, you
caught, old lady," he chuckled, as he twirled the
feather between forefinger and thumb, and then
stuck it in the band of his campaign hat. "Well,
it was a sorry night for the poor bird; but those
little foxes just had to have something to devour
ever so often. Now, I'd like to find out whether
this was a red fox; one of those dandy blacks
like we took out of the trap when we were up at
Uncle Caleb's woods cabin;<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> or a gray rascal. I'll
see if I can settle that part of it and satisfy my
curiosity."</p>

<p>It did not take long for a boy of such wide
experience as Elmer to find a clue on which to
build his theory. Inside of three minutes he came
to a place where the returning four-footed hunter
had to pass through close quarters, in pushing
under some brush. Elmer knew just where to
look, and was speedily laughing as he held up
several hairs he had found caught on a thorn.</p>

<p>"As red as any fox that ever crept up on a
sleeping partridge, and snatched her from her
nest in the thicket!" Elmer declared, also placing
the evidence away, for he would want to show
it to the tenderfoot squad, when telling the simple
story of the wonderful things he had come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
across while just taking a little ramble through
the woods.</p>

<p>And so it went on. One thing followed another
in endless procession. The red-headed woodpecker
tapping the rotten top of a tree; the bluejay
hunting worms or seeds amidst the dead
grass; the chipmunk that switched around to the
other side of a stump and then with sharp eyes
watched the two-legged intruder on its haunts
curiously; the harmless garter-snake that glided
from under his foot, though <i>giving</i> him a certain
thrill as he remembered the stories about these
deadly rattlers&mdash;all these, and many other things
arrested the attention of the boy who long ago
had become possessed of the magical key that
unlocks the storehouse of knowledge in Nature's
own kingdom.</p>

<p>And yet Elmer did not forget to always pay
attention to the course he was taking. He placed
numerous landmarks down in his memory, so that
he would know them again later on. Now it might
be an odd freak in the way of a bent-over tree,
that had the appearance of a drawn bow, with
some unseen giant of the woods standing back of
it, drawing the cord taut; then again a cluster of
white birches would be impressed on his mind, to
be readily recognized again in case the necessity
arose.</p>

<p>All this time he was heading in a direct line
toward that region where the blue spiral of smoke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
had been noticed in the still morning air. Elmer,
too, fancied, when an hour had passed, that he
must by now be drawing well along toward the
origin of the smoke column.</p>

<p>Possibly he may have questioned whether he
was exactly wise in thinking of invading the precincts
of the camp, that might prove to be the
home of the man who possessed the evil reputation.</p>

<p>"But my motives are all right," Elmer told
himself, when this arose to annoy him; "and I
mean no harm to Jem or his people, if so be he
<i>has</i> any family, which somehow no one ever bothered
to tell me, even if they knew. I guess Jem's
been something of a mystery to the people up
here. He seems to have no friends, and it may be
nobody ever did penetrate to his camp. Well,
then, I'll be the pioneer in the game. I'm not
afraid of Jem, for all his black looks. I'd just
like to get to <i>know</i> him, and find out if he's as
tough as they say."</p>

<p>And accordingly Elmer, instead of taking warning
from his fears and turning back, continued
resolutely along the course he had marked out
for himself. He would beard the lion in its den,
and try to convince this same poacher Jem that
he had nothing to fear from a party of boys out
on a holiday. Perhaps Elmer may have also had
some little scheme in mind whereby they could
do more or less good by utilizing some of those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
superabundant stores which George had cleverly
advised Rufus to lay in, under the possibility of
their being storm-bound up in the woods, with a
great need for much provisions. A little present
of excellent tea might quite win the heart of Jem's
wife, provided he had one; and Elmer had even
known of a case where the fragrant odor of coffee
had entirely disarmed a woods bully, who had
been half inclined to clean out the camp previous
to his inhaling that delicious perfume.</p>

<p>Now and then the boy would pause and commence
sniffing the air. He knew that he had been
walking directly up the wind for quite a while
now, and hence more than half expected that he
might catch the whiff of hard-wood smoke, telling
of the presence of a fire not far distant, and dead
ahead.</p>

<p>It was when Elmer was standing still and looking
about him that he suddenly heard a sound that
sent a peculiar thrill through his whole person.
There was nothing so strange about the sound in
itself, only the oddity of hearing it under such
peculiar conditions.</p>

<p>"Why, upon my soul, I do believe that's a violin
being tuned up!" he whispered, straining his ears
still more while speaking. "Yes, it is, for I can
hear the plain chords now. Perhaps some fiddler
who plays at country barn dances is passing
through the woods, and has stopped over night at
Jem's shack. Why, he seems to have a knack for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
striking wonderfully fine chords, it seems to me.
I'll just push on and see what it means."</p>

<p>This he accordingly did, and as he began to
catch the sound of music more plainly as he kept
advancing, Elmer found his curiosity rising to
fever heat. Now the notes of the weird music
came floating to him on the soft air, more and
more distinctly. It seemed to the boy as though
the violin fairly sobbed with the spirit of the one
whose fingers trailed the bow across those taut
strings.</p>

<p>"It's wonderful, that's what!" Elmer was telling
himself for the tenth time as he kept on walking,
and straining his hearing more and more.
"Why, I've heard some pretty fine players, but
never anything like that! Whoever can it be!
I'd wager a heap that the gift of inherited genius
is back of that playing. I can see that he isn't
an educated violinist at all; but the notes are
meant to express the language of the soul within.
Oh, I'm glad now I decided to start out; because
I wouldn't have missed this for anything!"</p>

<p>He knew that he was by now close to the spot,
for the sounds came very distinctly. As he continued
to advance, Elmer kept watching, wondering
what manner of person he was going to see.
Could some professional violinist have taken a
notion to spend his summer up here amidst the
solitudes, communing with Nature, so as to secure
new inspiration for his work? It would not be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
improbable, though there was that about the
playing to suggest an utter lack of training.</p>

<p>Now only a screen of bushes seemed to intervene.
Once he had crept to the further edge of
these and Elmer would be able to see the one who
handled that bow so eloquently.</p>

<p>Three minutes later and he found himself looking
eagerly out of his leafy screen, to receive a
fresh shock. Instead of a man with the looks of
a professor, or even a lady performer, he discovered
that the party responsible for those sweet
chords and sad strains that pierced his heart, was
only a flaxen-haired boy not over ten years of age!</p>

<p>He sat there with his slender legs coiled up on
a stump, and drew the wonderful notes from his
fiddle without any apparent effort, just as though
the music was in him, and had to find an outlet
somehow. He was barefooted, and dressed shabbily.
Yet, despite these evidences of poverty,
Elmer could note what seemed to be a distinguished
air about the lad that fairly stunned him.
He thought at once of Mark Twain's "The Prince
and the Pauper." Was this a real prince masquerading
in dingy apparel?</p>

<p>He lay there and drank in the wonderful harmony
for a full quarter of an hour, hardly daring
to move lest his actions frighten the little chap,
and cause that flood of music to cease. All the
while Elmer was trying to figure out what it could
mean. Was this boy Jem Shock's child; and, if so,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
how in the wide world could the child have come
into such an amazing musical inheritance? Who
was his mother, and had she sprung from some
genius known to the world of melody?</p>

<p>"No matter what the answer is," Elmer told
himself, "that child has genius deeply planted in
his soul; and it will be a burning shame if he
never has a chance to be educated along the right
channel. I'm bound to bring this up before some
of the good people at home, and see what can be
done. Oh! if only they could hear him as I am
doing right now, it would be easy to collect a sum
of money to start him on the road to becoming
the most famous of American violinists. I never
heard such wonderful music in all my life. He
mustn't get away from me now."</p>

<p>Elmer said this last because he saw that the
boy was apparently about to cease playing. He
had tucked his violin away in a much-soiled bag
of once green baize, and was climbing down from
the stump, as though to depart from the theatre
he apparently liked above all other places for his
daily concert.</p>

<p>So Elmer stepped forth and swiftly approached.
The boy did not hear his footsteps at first, for
Elmer knew how to tread softly; but presently he
looked around and for a moment the scout leader
feared he meant to dart away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MAKING A BARGAIN WITH CONRAD</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Hold</span> on, please, don't go away; I'd like to
talk with you, and tell you how much I've enjoyed
listening to your playing."</p>

<p>Upon hearing the stranger say these kind
words, the boy apparently reconsidered his intention
of running off. He drew himself up
proudly, and waited. Elmer saw that while he
was a very handsome little fellow, there was no
trace of weakness about his face; he had just as
resolute a chin as Jem Shock himself; and his
blue eyes could evidently flash fire if his spirit
were aroused.</p>

<p>So Elmer walked forward and joined the other.
Standing there barefooted, and with his clothing
well worn, though neatly patched, the boy presented
a strange appearance, hugging his cherished
violin in its faded case close under his arm.
Elmer would never forget the picture he had
made as he sat there drawing all those remarkable
sounds from the wooden case; he would have
labeled such a painting simply "Genius," and let
people catch the idea according to their bent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"You play very sweetly, my boy," he told the
other. "I have been listening for a long time.
Where did you learn how to handle the bow? Who
taught you to make a violin talk, and tell all the
things that you have been hearing the birds and
the little woods folks saying?"</p>

<p>"My mother showed me how to hold the bow,
and the rest I just picked up like, mister," the
boy replied.</p>

<p>Elmer was further astonished. He had expected
to hear this woods boy speak most ungrammatically;
but few lads of his age, who had
gone to school for five years or over, could have
expressed themselves one-half as well. But then
the same mother who had shown him how to grasp
the bow must have taken pains to teach him other
things that went with the education of a growing
boy. His observation had done the rest; for just
as Elmer himself was accustomed to doing, this
boy had ever heard a thousand voices in the solitudes
where he dwelt; and these elements he was
weaving into music as he dreamily drew his bow
again and again across the responsive strings.</p>

<p>"Do you live near here?" next asked Elmer,
who saw that the boy was curiously looking him
over, and seemed to be visibly impressed with his
khaki suit, as well as his leggings and his campaign
hat.</p>

<p>He noticed the glint of suspicion suddenly shoot
into the blue eyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you want to know that for?" he asked
sharply. "Are you a warden, or a revenue
officer?"</p>

<p>Elmer laughed in his customary cheery way
that usually proved so catching, and made him so
many friends.</p>

<p>"Well, I should say not, my friend," he hastened
to assure the other. "This is the regular uniform
of the Boy Scouts. Have you ever heard of the
scouts, and would you like me to tell you some
interesting things about them?"</p>

<p>The boy looked him all over again, and when
he saw what a frank and engaging face Elmer
had, he seemed to make up his mind that really he
ought to have no fear from so friendly a boy.</p>

<p>"Yes, I would, if you didn't mind telling me,"
he went on to say. "Once, a year or so ago,
mother took me to a town to have my teeth looked
over&mdash;I've got better clothes than these at the
cabin, you know&mdash;and while we were there I saw
a boy dressed like you are. He had a drum, and
was beating it ever so hard, making music that
nearly killed me, it was so terrible. But I didn't
know he was a scout. So I'd like to hear about
them, if you don't mind."</p>

<p>Accordingly, Elmer sat down on a convenient
log, it being a part of the very same tree the
stump of which the boy had utilized as his rostrum,
when playing his sad airs to an imaginary
audience.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come and sit beside me, please," he went on to
say, encouragingly; "and first, before I start
talking, I ought to introduce myself. My name
is Elmer Chenowith, and I live in the town of
Hickory Ridge. Would you mind telling me your
name, because, you see, it's rather awkward for
two boys to chat without knowing how to speak to
each other."</p>

<p>"I'm Conrad!" the boy said simply, as he took
the designated seat, and carefully placed his
precious violin on the ground beside him.</p>

<p>"Conrad Shock?" continued Elmer, at which the
boy shut his teeth hard, and then almost defiantly
said:</p>

<p>"Yes, and Jem Shock is my father, too, if you
want to know it!"</p>

<p>"That's all right, Conrad," the other told him.
"I have heard a lot about Jem, but I don't believe
much of what is told me. Besides, it's none of
my business, and I don't mean to meddle with
anybody else's affairs. Now I want to be friends
with you. I must hear about your gift of playing,
because you have got it without a question. After
I've told you all about scouts, and what they aim
to do in the world, I hope you'll tell me about
yourself, Conrad."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I will, Elmer," the other replied,
calmly.</p>

<p>So once again the story of scout craft was told
in simple language. The boy hung upon every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
word as though he felt the keenest interest in all
he heard. And never could there have been a
more zealous narrator than the leader of the
Wolf Patrol; for Elmer's heart was wrapped up
in his present calling as typified in the khaki, and
he fairly fascinated his young auditor by relating
how the scouts took upon themselves so many
uplifting resolutions; how they learned new things
every day by observing, and remembering what
they saw and heard; also how the movement was
widening in its scope continually until even the
Government at Washington had taken notice of
its beneficial effect upon the youth of the land,
and was at last legislating in behalf of the organization.</p>

<p>"And now," he said in conclusion, "you understand
who and what we are. I have four chums
along with me, two of them new beginners whom
we call tenderfeet, because they know so little
about the great book of Nature, and have so much
to learn. We came up here, partly to camp out
and enjoy ourselves as scouts always do when
they get the chance. Then it happens that the
father of one of the boys has bought a big tract
of land around Raccoon Bluff, and his son wanted
to survey it over, not being satisfied with the
original work. We chanced to see your father
while we were on the road, and told him this, but
I'm afraid he didn't wholly believe us; but, Conrad,
I give you my word of honor as a scout that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
we haven't the least idea of spying on him, or
doing him any harm. Do you believe me?"</p>

<p>The boy looked him in the eye, and doubtless
soul spoke to soul in that exchange of looks, for
he presently said, slowly but positively:</p>

<p>"Yes, you could never tell a lie if you wanted
to, Elmer. And I'm going to tell you that my
father has been acting queer ever since he met you
boys on the road. I don't know what ails him, but
I heard him saying a name over and over again,
and looking ever so black."</p>

<p>"What was the name; can you tell me, Conrad?"</p>

<p>"It was a funny one&mdash;Snodgrass," the boy replied,
and Elmer shivered when he heard him say
this, for it came to him like a flash that possibly
Jem Shock might have some reason to think of
that name with anything but pleasant memories.</p>

<p>"That is the name of the new boy whose father
owns this property up here," he admitted; "but
he came from some other section of the country,
and has only been in our town a few months. Tell
me about your mother, for you say she showed
you how to hold the bow. Did she used to play
the violin herself long ago?"</p>

<p>"Oh! no, it was her father, the celebrated
player, Ovid Anderson. He is long since dead,
you know. And this was his violin, too, with
which he used to charm so many thousands of
people. My mother has often told me how they
would take him on their shoulders and march up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the street shouting that he was the greatest player
in all the wide world. And some day I mean to
be his equal; I feel it in here," and as the boy
said this most solemnly, he placed a hand on his
bosom, where his heart beat most tumultuously,
and called upon him for deeds worthy of the name
his ancestor had made famous.</p>

<p>For Elmer had himself heard that name of
Ovid Anderson. He remembered that the player,
long since dead, had been a Swedish violinist of
international reputation. How it came that his
daughter should ever mate with a man like Jem
Shock, and be lost to the world in this wilderness,
was a puzzle too much for Elmer to understand.</p>

<p>But he hoped that all in good time he might find
the explanation; for now that he had made the
acquaintance of Conrad he was more determined
than ever to meet that mother, even if in doing so
he had to run the gauntlet of Jem Shock's anger.</p>

<p>But Conrad was showing evidences now of a
desire to depart. Elmer would have liked to ask
to accompany him to his cabin home, but he hesitated.
Still he meant to pave the way to a future
meeting, and then it might be time to ask to meet
the boy's mother.</p>

<p>"Our camp is up on the bluff, where the road
runs. You can see the smoke of our fire, and perhaps
the tent under the trees, if you look that
way. And we'd be glad to have you and your
mother, yes, and Jem Shock, too, visit us any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
time, Conrad, if you felt inclined that way. Do
you often come here to play the things that you
feel in your soul?"</p>

<p>"Every morning when it isn't raining, and then
the day is very long to me, for I believe I would
die if it wasn't for the music," the boy hurriedly
replied. "But I want to thank you for saying
what you did about my father. I know people
all say he is a terribly bad man, that he gets
drunk, and beats us; but it's a whole pack of lies,
that's what it is. He never drinks a drop. He
seems to hold a grudge against the whole world
for something that happened a while ago, but he
is good to my mother, and he loves me, he says,
like the apple of his eye."</p>

<p>"I'm mighty glad to hear that, Conrad, sure I
am!" exclaimed Elmer. "Lots of times people
are given bad names when they don't deserve
them one whit. I made up my mind that I wanted
to know your father, and some day I mean to
drop in at your cabin and introduce myself. Yes,
and tomorrow I'll be coming over here again
as sure as anything, to listen to you play some
more. Some day you will get your chance to take
lessons from some big professor, who will fit you
for taking the place your famous grandfather
filled. And perhaps I may be able to start the
ball rolling; you wait and see."</p>

<p>Conrad turned white with the wild hope that
surged through his ambitious young heart. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
wrung Elmer's hand eagerly as he said goodbye.
The scout leader watched him going on through
the aisles of the forest, and noticed that his
course took him directly toward the place where
the smoke came from.</p>

<p>Fully satisfied with the adventure of the morning,
and filled with a growing ambition to be the
one to interest music-loving friends in the wonderful
genius of the great Ovid Anderson's grandson,
Elmer turned in his tracks, and commenced
to head for the camp.</p>

<p>"I never dreamed of such a thing happening
to me, when I consented to come up here and help
Rufus make his new survey," he was telling himself,
as he walked on, never forgetting to note
his surroundings, as a true woodsman always
must, no matter what his mind may be occupied
with. "And wouldn't it be a great thing, though,
if we did manage to get that boy's mother to bring
him down to town, so the folks who love music
could only hear him play. Why, they'd go crazy
over him, I'm sure, and the rest would be as easy
as falling off a log."</p>

<p>Somehow Elmer failed to pay as much attention
to animated nature around him on his return
trip as he had when going out; but then that was
not to be wondered at. He had really run across
a most remarkable thing; and it crowded most
other matters out of his mind.</p>

<p>When he reached camp, he found George still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
"up to his eyes" in work, and enjoying every
minute of the morning. The fixing up of camp
was such a pleasure to him that for the time
being he seemed transformed into a real sociable
fellow, quite different from his usual complaining
self.</p>

<p>Elmer told him of his adventure, and George
was mildly interested. He did not happen to be
much of a lover of music himself, and perhaps
thought Elmer might be overestimating the ability
of a boy player.</p>

<p>"Oh! there are plenty such cropping up from
time to time, I reckon," he remarked, scornfully;
"but they seldom amount to a row of beans. You
thought this little chap was some punkins just
because you happened to hear him amidst peculiar
surroundings. Now, the chances are when
you listen to him in a concert hall you'll be bitterly
disappointed in his genius, as you like to
call it."</p>

<p>"You're jumping at conclusions too fast, as
usual, George," the scout leader told the objector.
"In the first place, Conrad will never be heard
on the concert stage while he is as green as he is
along the lines of musical culture. He will show
what is in him to genuine critics, and then if they
prove as wild over him as I believe they are
bound to be, he'll be put under the charge of the
best teacher in New York City, to begin along
the proper lines."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>As George was so busily employed, and Elmer
had nothing else to do, he started getting lunch
ready later on. There was an abundance of material
to choose from, and it was really a pleasure
to make the selection. So presently savory odors
began to arise in the vicinity, that, when wafted
to the olfactories of the three boys coming wearily
back over their morning trail would be sure to
hasten their footsteps.</p>

<p>It was easy to see that Rufus had made more
or less progress along the lines of carrying out
his plans for checking up the previous survey.</p>

<p>"Of course it's a whole lot too soon," he told
Elmer, when he came into camp and threw himself
down to rest, "to say that the job was pretty
much of a bungle; but I'm beginning to believe
that same. And before two suns have set I'll have
the figures to prove it, too."</p>

<p>"What object do you suppose those civil engineers
could have had in rushing it all through,
and doing a rotten job in the bargain?" demanded
George. "Could it be possible there was some
crooked work back of the survey, and that they
took a money bribe to falsify the figures? In
other words, has your respected dad been stung
when buying some square miles of ground up here
along Raccoon Bluff?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm hardly prepared to go as far as that,"
said Rufus, hastily. "I'd be more inclined to believe
that the men who came up here just slouched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
at their work and failed to do what they should.
They made a slash three-quarters of the way
back in one place, we found, and then probably
guessed the rest. It's going to turn out a bad
piece of work, and they'll hear from my dad, you
can wager. The Snodgrass pluck and vim won't
stand for such monkey shines one minute, as any
person who knows my father can tell you."</p>

<p>Elmer suddenly remembered how the lad with
the flaxen hair had said that his father, Jem
Shock, seemed to cherish a singular antipathy
toward some one by the name of Snodgrass; and
that ever since meeting them on the road, he had
kept repeating it to himself, and frowning as
though furious. He wondered again whether that
rich father of Rufus could at some time in the
past have wronged the same Jem in a real estate
deal. It would be very unfortunate if such proved
to be the case; and might spoil some of the plans
he, Elmer, had been building up, connected with
the wonderful boy musician.</p>

<p>Later on, while they were discussing the lunch,
he started in and told Lil Artha, Rufus and Alec
what he had run across. All of them were greatly
interested; but the scout-master, for reasons of
his own, failed to mention that the man who was
called a "poacher," and who had somehow gained
the name of a bad man, seemed to hold hard feelings
against a Snodgrass.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Rufus was loud in his desire to help the "cause"
along.</p>

<p>"If ever you can coax these woods people to let
the boy come to town, Elmer," he went on to say
loftily, though also with considerable feeling,
"I'll promise to interest my folks in him. And
my father thinks a lot of anybody who has musical
talent. I know he took a heap of pleasure in
helping to send one young lady to Europe to complete
her voice culture; she's now singing in
opera, and thinks she owes considerable of her
dazzling success to what he did for her. She's
often been at our house when we lived nearer
New York."</p>

<p>"That sounds good to me, Rufus," Elmer told
him; "and if the opening comes I may call on you
to redeem your promise."</p>

<p>At the same time, Elmer wondered whether it
might not be the irony of fate if the same man
who had helped "down" the father, were to stretch
out a helping hand to the son. He also figured
that Jem Shock would indignantly refuse to
accept any aid from that source. But then the
whole thing was wrapped in mystery; and Elmer,
like a wise boy, decided that it would be foolish
to try to figure things out until he had a better
grip on the conditions.</p>

<p>After lunch, the surveying party, considerably
refreshed by their meal, and the hour of loafing
about the camp, went off again to take up the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
work where they had dropped it. George, too,
had found some other things which he might as
well do while his hand was in; and so Elmer had
to cast around him for some means of passing
the long afternoon away.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A PERIL THAT LAY IN WAIT</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was an hour and more after the surveying
party had trooped forth, bearing their paraphernalia
for a good afternoon's work, when Elmer
happened to remember something. He was himself
getting ready to take another tramp, though
in a different direction than his morning stroll
took him.</p>

<p>"Seems to me, George," he remarked, casually,
"I've heard you say you liked honey pretty well?"</p>

<p>George stopped fretting over what he was
doing, and licked his lips at the mere mention of
the word "honey."</p>

<p>"Finest stuff that ever was made; that is, when
you get the real article, and none of that sugar-water
imitation some bee-keepers put on the
market nowadays, which tastes as insipid as mucilage.
Yum! yum! makes my mouth water when
I think of all the good times I used to have when
we kept bees. But father had the misfortune to
upset a hive, and got so badly stung that he
bundled the lot off at a bargain price to an old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
farmer. But what makes you speak of it now,
Elmer? Just to tantalize me, because that was one
of the things I had Rufus put on his list and he
forgot to get, worse luck."</p>

<p>"Oh! I only wanted to say that perhaps we
may find a chance while we're up here to lay in a
store of luscious honey, if we have half-way good
luck, George."</p>

<p>"Does that farmer keep bees, and do you mean
some of us can take a run back to his place to
buy a bucket of comb?" asked George, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Better than that," chuckled Elmer. "I've noticed
a great many wild bees working in the flowers,
and I think I can track them to their woods
hive. Once we find where they hold out, it won't
be hard to chop the tree down, and take our fill
of the newest stores."</p>

<p>"A splendid idea, Elmer, I give you my word
if it isn't!" cried the other, looking greatly
pleased. "It certainly takes you to think up fine
things. And when you start to follow the honey-makers
home, please let me go along. I've always
wanted to see how that dodge is worked."</p>

<p>"We'll all be on deck," the scout-master assured
him; "for above everything else I want the tenderfoot
squad to learn a practical lesson on how
easy it is for an experienced woodsman to find
his bread and butter and sweets by using his
brains instead of hard cash. But we'll lay our
plans tonight while we sit around the fire."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"Off for another tramp now, are you, Elmer?"
George continued, as he saw the other pick up
his handy stick again.</p>

<p>"Well, yes; I don't like to waste such a glorious
day; and there's really nothing for me to do
around camp, since you've taken the run of things
in your hands."</p>

<p>"Going off to see that wonderful child fiddler
again. I suppose, Elmer?"</p>

<p>"You guessed wrong that time, George, because
I've laid out to follow after our civil engineering
party, and see how Rufus is getting on with his
work. He certainly is in love with it; and his
father will be unwise if he doesn't encourage the
boy in every way possible. I tell you, a host of
fellows have made failures of their lives because
their parents insisted on their taking up some
profession they hated."</p>

<p>"Just so, Elmer," chirped George, "a case of
round pegs in square holes, so to speak. And
when I get to the point of choosing what I want
to be as a man, I hope my folks won't force me
to go contrary to my liking."</p>

<p>Knowing George's stubborn qualities, Elmer
could easily guess that the Robbins tribe would
have a pretty hard task of it bending <i>him</i> to their
will. However, he did not say this, not wishing
to either offend George or arouse his argumentative
powers, but started forth on his tramp.</p>

<p>"'Course you'll just keep an eye on their trail,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
won't you, Elmer?" the camp-guardian called out
after him.</p>

<p>"It would be silly to try any other way, George,"
he was told.</p>

<p>So Elmer went on. The tracks left by the three
surveyors could hardly have been overlooked,
even by the veriest greenhorn at trailing, for they
had none of them made the least attempt to hide
their footprints. So Elmer had an easy task of it,
and indeed could employ his extra time in observing
many things around him.</p>

<p>He saw the mother rabbit start out of the bunch
of grass where doubtless her offspring lay hidden,
and with halting steps act as though badly injured.
Elmer laughed, and clapped his hands as
though in keen appreciation for her cleverness.</p>

<p>"The same old trick birds and small animals
always play when they want to lure a trespasser
away from their nest," he told himself; "by endangering
themselves in the desire to save their
young. She coaxes me to rush after her, so as
to wean me away from her brood. If I started
she'd go off a little farther, and then stop once
more to coax me on again. I've seen a hen partridge
do the same thing, fluttering along the
ground as if with a broken wing. Now just for
fun let's see if I'm not right."</p>

<p>He had carefully noted the exact spot where
the mother rabbit first appeared, and stepping
over that way parted the tall grass. Instantly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
there was a hurried scurrying, as a number of
small but nimble half-grown rabbits darted this
way and that, as if greatly frightened.</p>

<p>"Don't kill yourselves trying to escape, little
bunnies," said Elmer, greatly amused; "because
I wouldn't harm a single hair of your pretty bodies.
But I tell you the thousand-and-one lessons
that a fellow can learn from Nature's big book
ought to be enough to make every boy want to become
a scout, and take up the study of outdoor life.
There's something fresh and new every day one
lives."</p>

<p>By then the devoted mother rabbit had vanished,
doubtless filled with consternation over the
dispersal of her brood, which she would have to
call together in some fashion of her own. So
Elmer walked on, observing many other interesting
things as he proceeded, for his eyes were ever
on the alert when he went into the woods and
cruised on the waters.</p>

<p>He guessed that he must be gradually drawing
up on his three chums, for occasionally he caught
the sound of a halloo, as though there might be
an exchange of signals between Rufus and his
stakeman, who went on ahead to assist him. Lil
Artha probably prowled along near by, seeing
things for himself, and with not a great deal of
interest in the prosaic operations of the surveyors.</p>

<p>Suddenly Elmer heard loud excited voices. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
believed be caught the voice of Lil Artha saying,
"Steady, Rufus, don't move on your life&mdash;steady,
boy!"</p>

<p>Then came a loud report. Elmer knew that it
was the discharge of the lanky scout's gun. He
was already plunging forward as fast as he could
go when this sound came to his startled ears.
The others were close by, for he could now hear
their excited voices.</p>

<p>A minute later, and Elmer, still on the full run,
burst through a thicket, and discovered the three
boys. Lil Artha had his gun half raised to his
shoulder, as if doubtful whether the newcomer
would prove to be a friend or an enemy; and with
true scout preparedness not meaning to be taken
off his guard. But on sighting Elmer, of course
he lowered his weapon.</p>

<p>Rufus was standing there, looking as "white
as a ghost," and trembling as if he had the ague.
Alec grasped his small ax, and seemed quite
ready to use the same. Something twisted and
squirmed upon the ground, and as Elmer looked,
his horrified gaze made out an enormous rattlesnake
that seemed to have part of its head shot
away. The chilling sound of its rattles was what
Elmer had thought to be the "chill" of a buzzing
locust upon some neighboring tree.</p>

<p>In another moment Elmer was alongside Rufus.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me the thing struck you, Rufus?"
he ejaculated, himself pale with apprehension.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's all right, Elmer," said Lil Artha, soothingly.
"Nobody hurt the least mite, I give you
my word. But if Rufus hadn't had the good sense
to stand still when I called out, I really believe
the critter would have struck at him. And it was
close enough to make a hit, too."</p>

<p>"I don't deserve any credit, fellows, indeed I
don't!" said Rufus, truthfully. "I was so scared
that I seemed frozen stiff. Why, I couldn't have
moved hand or foot for all the money in the world.
Guess that's what they mean when they say a
rattler charms people."</p>

<p>"It may be so," Lil Artha went on to say, "but
I've known one to get birds to flutter within
reach, just as if there was something magical in
the whirr of that buzz rattle at the end of its tail.
After all, I guess it was lucky that I <i>did</i> conclude
to fetch my gun along this afternoon. The boys
were laughing at me in the morning for lugging
it when I didn't mean to fire a shot at any game.
But say, a measly rattler hasn't any close season;
he's a fit object for business, summer or fall."</p>

<p>"You made a cracking fine shot, Lil Artha,"
commented Elmer, after stepping closer to observe
the result of the other's quick aim.</p>

<p>"Oh! middling, middling, partner," chuckled
the tall scout, modestly; "I oughtn't to be proud
of it; but then I own up I was some rattled for
fear Rufus would move, and make the snake shoot
forward with that poised flat head of his. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
I stopped his fun all right, which ought to be
enough for me."</p>

<p>"But how d'ye suppose I missed the fearsome
de-il?" asked Alec, wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Oh! I happened to step aside while getting my
bearings for that last sight," explained the trembling
Rufus, "and must have drawn too near
where the viper was coiled up for defense. First
thing I knew was hearing what I took to be the
whirr of a locust. Then I looked down and saw
it! After that I seemed to turn to ice. I heard
Lil Artha coming, and afterwards he said something.
When he fired I nearly fell over, thinking
I had been shot. Oh! I'll never forget my sensations;
and after this I'm going to keep on the
lookout all the time for snakes."</p>

<p>"It pays to be on the watch," assented Elmer.
"The fellow who keeps his eyes about him in
the woods is doubly armed. We must drag it back
with us, and show George. He said he didn't believe
there was any truth in that farmer's story
about rattlesnakes up here. We'll have to show
him."</p>

<p>"But, Elmer, supposing it had given me a crack,
would I have had to die? Is there any remedy
for a rattlesnake's poison?" asked Rufus.</p>

<p>"Oh! we'd have pulled you through all right,
depend on it, Rufus," said Lil Artha, taking it
upon himself to answer the question. "I'd have
sucked the wound in the first place, making sure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
that I had no scratch or abrasion about my mouth
so that I couldn't be infected by the poison that
I ejected. Then Elmer here, who is a pretty good
surgeon when it comes right down to brass tacks,
would have cut into the wound, and afterwards,
when it had bled freely, he'd apply some stuff he
always carries with him to neutralize the poison.
Some people give whiskey, and perhaps it does
help; but science and medicine have found a better
remedy."</p>

<p>"Then why are there so many fatal cases of
snake bites?" asked Rufus, determined to find out
all he could on the subject.</p>

<p>"Well, most of them are neglected too long,"
Elmer told him. "The person who has been struck
may be alone at the time; or if he has companions,
they become panic-stricken, and only think of
hurrying the poor chap to the nearest doctor as
fast as they can. That's nearly always the worst
thing they could do, for in the time it takes, the
deadly poison has had a chance to circulate
through the blood, and all the doctors going
couldn't save the patient."</p>

<p>"That's where first aid to the injured comes in
with the scouts," said Lil Artha, proudly. "All
boys who wear the khaki are instructed how to
act in order to save human life by prompt measures,
whether it is in case of near-drowning,
snake bite, injury by cutting an artery with an
ax, swallowing some poisonous toadstool in place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
of delicious mushrooms, and a dozen other things
too numerous to mention. You'll learn all about
it in good time, Rufus."</p>

<p>"I mean to, Lil Artha, depend on it," the other
assured him earnestly. "I give you my solemn
word here and now that I'll begin right away. I
never want to be taken unawares again, so that
I feel as helpless as a kitten. I'm going to be
aimed and equipped with the book of knowledge.
I can see that it pays compound interest for all
your time and trouble."</p>

<p>"Now I'm delighted to hear you say that,
Rufus," Lil Artha told him; "and I promise to
instruct you at the first opportunity; Alec, too,
if he is so minded."</p>

<p>"I am verra curious aboot it, and ye can count
on me being a listener whenever ye begin the
lessons. Aye! it would hae been peetiful if Rufus
had been struck. I'd hae sucked his wound with
ye, Lil Artha, or done anything else ye asked."</p>

<p>Rufus laid a hand on the Scotch boy's shoulder
fondly.</p>

<p>"I'm sure you would, Sandy," he went on to
say, for sometimes he used that name in speaking
to his comrade, though always with affection.
"But after that fright I guess I'm done working
for today. Let's go back to camp."</p>

<p>No one raised any objections, so they prepared
to return. Lil Artha managed to fasten a strong
cord to the tail of the rattlesnake, which Alec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
said he would drag after him. The long-legged
scout had already shown the two tenderfeet the
cruel looking curved fangs in the partly shattered
head, as well as the sickly, green-hued poison that
could be pressed from the sack by using a stick
on a certain part of the said head. They had been
greatly impressed, and likewise shocked to realize
what a narrow escape both of them had had from
near-death.</p>

<p>All the way back the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'walk'">talk</ins> was of the hidden
perils that lie in wait for unsuspecting passersby
in the woods. This ranged from wildcats to rattlesnakes
and adders and scorpions. Lil Artha
seemed to be a "walking encyclopedia" of knowledge
along these lines; part of this he had picked
up through personal experience, and the rest came
through extensive reading, or hearing others tell
about it. A scout may find scores of ways for
learning useful things, if only he cares to bother
about doing it.</p>

<p>Later on they approached the camp.</p>

<p>George, who had managed to get through with
his numerous odd jobs and was resting, seemed
surprised, to have them come back so soon.</p>

<p>"Huh! guess you got tired of the job quicker'n
you expected, Rufus!" he called out lazily from
his seat on the soft moss under a tree. "All work
and no play makes Jack a dull boy, they say. But
what in the dickens is that you're dragging along
after you, Alec? Great Scott! a rattler!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>George scrambled to his feet, filled with excitement.
His eyes stared at the four-foot reptile,
which still showed signs of life; and Lil Artha had
assured Alec its tail would continue to jerk until
sundown, even though its head be cut clean off.</p>

<p>"I hope it didn't strike any of you fellows?"
George went on to add with a vein of fright in
his voice.</p>

<p>The story was quickly told, and the convinced
George had to measure the reptile with his tape
line, finding it only an inch or two short of four
feet.</p>

<p>"As big a rattler as I ever saw," Elmer told
them. "They have them five feet long down in
Florida, I understand, those diamond-back fellows;
but as I haven't been there I can't say anything
about it. For a Northern snake this one is
certainly a whopper."</p>

<p>"Lil Artha has promised to get the rattle for
me," remarked Alec. "Rufus had the first choice,
but man, he said he'd never sleep easy nichts if
he had it hangin' on the wall of his room at home,
thinking about his narrow escape. But it's a verra
curious thing to me, and I don't care a bawbee
about the sound. It wasn't <i>my</i> ox that was gored,
ye ken."</p>

<p>George was acting now in something of a mysterious
manner. Elmer noticed this and was looking
at the camp-keeper out of the tail of his eye,
as though trying to guess what was in the wind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
He felt certain that George had a secret of some
kind or other, which he was holding back, just for
the satisfaction it gave him.</p>

<p>Lil Artha was an observing chap, as we happen
to know; and before long he too noticed the same
thing. This, however, was after he had seen
Elmer observing George closely, with a line across
his forehead that told of a puzzled mind.</p>

<p>The tall scout was not the one to bother himself
about trying to solve a thing when there was
a short cut to the answer. He believed that the
best way to get at the meat in a cocoanut was to
smash the shell.</p>

<p>"Here, what's brewing with you, George?" he
suddenly demanded, facing the other.</p>

<p>George grinned, and then hastened to say:</p>

<p>"What makes you ask that, Lil Artha?"</p>

<p>"Because I know right well you've got something
of a surprise up your sleeve, and you're
aching to spring it on us. What have you been
doing since we left camp? Now don't you
squirm, and try to keep us in the dark. Own up,
George, and tell us."</p>

<p>So George, seeing there was no escape, apparently,
determined to let the "cat out of the
bag."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE STRANGE MESSAGE JEM LEFT</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Well</span>, we've had a visitor in camp since you
fellows all went away!" George confessed.</p>

<p>Of course every one was interested. Lil
Artha seemed to immediately jump to the conclusion
that the guest must have been a four-footed
one.</p>

<p>"Bet you now, it was a measly wildcat," he hastened
to exclaim. "It's too bad a fellow with a
gun can't be in two places at the same time. I was
needed out with the tenderfoot squad; and seems
like I could have been made useful here at home.
Did the varmint get away with any of our grub,
George?"</p>

<p>The camp defender grinned as though amused.</p>

<p>"Go a bit slow, Lil Artha, can't you?" he complained,
petulantly. "Don't rush as if you knew it
all. Nobody said the visitor was going on four
feet, did they? Why, it happened to be a biped,
a man!"</p>

<p>"Then it was Jem Shock!" ventured Elmer,
quickly, as though he had half guessed the answer
before then.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just who it was," agreed George, nodding his
head in the affirmative, and looking very important.</p>

<p>"What did he want?" demanded Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"Hold your horses!" continued Elmer; "don't
keep jumping at conclusions so fast. In the first
place, remember that we invited Jem to drop in
on us any time he was near our camp. The invitation
didn't seem to give him much joy, but later
on he may have concluded to make a call. Now
tell us what he said, and how he looked, George."</p>

<p>"Oh! he carried that gun of his just as we saw
him before," the other explained. "And he certainly
looked pretty savage, in the bargain."</p>

<p>"Savage?" echoed Rufus, "why should he act
that way? Possibly because my father owns about
all this property up here. Perhaps Jem believes
he may be dispossessed of his cabin. I've heard
that squatters always do get to thinking they own
the land they build on, as if possession gave them
a quit claim deed."</p>

<p>"Well," continued George, steadily, and keeping
his eye fixed on Rufus, "to tell the honest truth,
he seemed most of all interested about <i>you</i>,
Rufus."</p>

<p>"Oh! is that so?" sneered the other; "well, that's
just about in line with what I was telling you. He
knows the name of Snodgrass, apparently."</p>

<p>"I guessed he did from the way he acted after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
I'd told him about your father," George went on
to say.</p>

<p>"Now, what could you have to say about my
dad?" snapped the touchy Rufus.</p>

<p>"Well, Jem asked me first of all if one of the
boys in camp was a Snodgrass, and of course I
told him yes," George explained. "Then he asked
me if I knew what your father's first name was.
I told him I had heard it, but just then, somehow,
it seemed to have slipped my memory. At that
he up and asked me if it was Hiram."</p>

<p>Rufus gave a little cry at hearing this.</p>

<p>"It might be this man knew my father once on
a time, or they may have had some business deal
together; though that's hardly likely, because Jem
Shock, poacher and farm laborer, would hardly be
the one <i>my</i> father would be friendly with."</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about that," said George,
swiftly; "but when I told him I remembered, on
his mentioning it, that Hiram was your father's
name, he gritted those big white teeth of his like
everything, and his eyes certainly looked wicked
enough to give a fellow a shiver."</p>

<p>"But didn't he say anything to explain why he
had come to the camp?" asked Lil Artha, deeply
interested in the story.</p>

<p>"He asked no favor, neither would he sit down
and have a cup of coffee when I offered to make
him one," George went on; "but he asked me to
give you a message which he wanted you to carry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
to your father when you went home. He said:
'Tell that Snodgrass boy to say to his father that
Jem Shock never will forgive the rank treachery
that handed him over to a gang of sharpers in the
land speculating business. And tell Hiram Snodgrass,
too,' he went on, 'that he ought to thank his
stars his son wasn't treated by Jem Shock as he
deserved. Only for the prayers of a good woman
in his cabin, and the influence of a sweet child, Jem
Shock'd be tempted to do something wicked to
wipe out the debt he owed your father.'"</p>

<p>Rufus went white on hearing this. Then the
color surged back to his cheeks and his eyes
sparkled like twin fires.</p>

<p>"It's all wrong, I'm sure it must be!" he cried,
angrily. "I know my father better than most
people do, and I'm as certain as I breathe that he
wouldn't deliberately betray anybody who trusted
in his word. There must be some terrible mistake
about it, don't you see, fellows? I'll bring you face
to face with my dad when I'm telling him about
this, and you'll hear for yourselves what he says.
But nothing can shake my confidence in his integrity;
I've seen it tested too many times to doubt
him now, just because this poacher fellow dares
accuse him of wrong doing."</p>

<p>It sounded very fine, this defense on the part
of a loyal son, and Elmer could only admire Rufus
for showing himself so faithful. At the same time,
he knew real-estate dealers often have a peculiar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
code of morals, and frequently do things that
others may not exactly approve of, salving their
own consciences in some way. Elmer was a little
afraid that Hiram Snodgrass might have been
tempted to turn a client over to some combination
of operators, some of whom were not just as scrupulous
as an honest man would like to have them
in his dealings.</p>

<p>"Was that all he said, George?" asked Lil Artha,
out of pity for Rufus, who appeared to be suffering
acutely from mental pain.</p>

<p>"Yes, and after delivering the message, he
whirled around and walked away with the grand
air of a lord of the realm," George explained.
"Somehow, poacher that he may be, because he
believes like a good many persons that wild game
isn't the property of the State, there's something
about Jem Shock that tells me he isn't a common
dickey. He hates all human kind because his nature
has been soured by some wrong he's endured,
that's all."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going to find out what it all means,
and as soon as I get the chance," Rufus asserted,
between his set teeth. "If it was a mistake, it shall
be righted. I tell you my father is too big a man
to play mean toward anybody. But while we're
up here nothing can be done. I wish I had a
chance to ask this fellow what it's all about, so I
could get the hang of things."</p>

<p>"H'm! if I were you, Rufus," suggested wise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
George, "I'd go slow about showing myself to Jem
Shock. He hates the sound of your name, and if
you gave him half an excuse, why he might forget
his good resolutions, and hurt you, with the idea
of revenging himself on your dad. How about
that, Elmer; is my logic sound?"</p>

<p>"Yes, there's no use taking unnecessary risks,"
admitted the scout-master, "and common prudence
demands that Rufus should keep away from Jem.
Later on, if he does find that a terrible mistake has
been made, it would be easy to come back up here
and square things up with the poacher. But it
certainly pleases me to know that the home influence
is working on Jem's revengeful mind. If the
mother is anything like that splendid little clear-eyed
chap I don't wonder at it, either."</p>

<p>Secretly, Elmer was more determined than ever
to try and make the personal acquaintance of Conrad's
mother, the daughter of that once famous
Swedish violinist whose bow had thrilled countless
thousands, and drawn genuine tears from their
eyes.</p>

<p>The subject was by common consent dropped
then and there, though, of course, it would remain
to agitate the mind of Rufus long afterwards.
Indeed, the boy seemed to be unusually quiet during
the balance of that afternoon, and even while
they sat around the crackling camp-fire after supper
had been disposed of.</p>

<p>Elmer could guess the reason why. The tenderfoot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
had, in the first place, been under a most
severe strain when he experienced that peril with
the deadly snake. It would have an effect upon
his nervous system for some little time; and possibly
he might even awaken from sleep occasionally
with a half-suppressed cry of horror, as
though in his dreams he again saw that horrid
reptile with its great coils, its flat square head
drawn back for striking, and its tail elevated so
that the monotonous danger signal at the tip could
continue to buzz angrily.</p>

<p>Then again the boy had taken that accusation
on the part of the poacher quite to heart. It could
be easily seen that he had a great affection for his
father, even though it was his fond mother who
had always given in to his whims, and come near
utterly spoiling Rufus by her favors.</p>

<p>"It galls him to have heard any one accuse his
father of being a trickster," was what Elmer told
himself, as he noticed the soberness of Rufus,
while the others in the circle about the fire chattered
away, and seemed to be enjoying themselves
hugely.</p>

<p>He had not changed his own plans a particle on
account of hearing about the visit paid to the camp
by Jem Shock. If anything, his resolution was
stronger than ever to see more of Conrad, and
perhaps meet his mother.</p>

<p>All of them were pretty tired, and, of course,
as the tenderfoot pair had secured so little sleep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
on the first night, it was likely they would soon
be "dead to the world" after letting their heads
fall on their crude pillows. These were made out
of a slip filled with sweet hemlock browse stripped
by hand fresh from the tree, and fragrant as could
be, with the incense of the woods. This bosky odor
in itself is said to be conducive to sound slumber;
at least all who spend their vacations close to
Nature's heart so affirm, and they should know.</p>

<p>The night passed without any sort of alarm.
Indeed, Alec and Rufus, once they got to sleep,
knew next to nothing up to the time Lil Artha
aroused them by beating on his frying-pan gong,
as "the first call to breakfast."</p>

<p>They were glad to see that again the weather
favored them, since there were all the signs of a
pleasant day ahead. Elmer, however, warned the
new recruits not to be too optimistic, because after
the warmth of the last few days, it was likely that
some sort of storm might develop.</p>

<p>It was arranged that George should change
places with Lil Artha on this day, and accompany
the two surveyors as a guard. The tall scout insisted
on his carrying the gun along with him.</p>

<p>"Of course you won't need it to shoot any deer
you happen to scare up, George," the owner went
on to tell him, "but, as we saw yesterday, there
may crop up conditions that make the having of
a shooting-iron mighty handy. You may not need
a gun at all, but if you do you want it right there."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Lil Artha possibly had something in mind which
he wanted to do while left behind. He kept his
own counsel, however, and Elmer, knowing that
the tall scout was to be thoroughly trusted, did
not ask questions.</p>

<p>So along about nine in the morning, when he
thought it likely he would be apt to find Conrad
seated in his favorite nook and playing some of his
dreamy airs, all of them creations of his own
brain, Elmer started forth. Lil Artha of course
could easily surmise from the direction he took
that he meant to look the boy up again, but immersed
in his own affairs, he said nothing, only
waved a cheery goodbye after the other.</p>

<p>So Elmer strode along, and this time he paid
a little less attention to the many interesting
things that cropped up on this side or that, for his
thoughts were mostly concerned with Conrad, and
his quaint thrilling music, which he yearned to
hear again.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A CABIN IN THE CLEARING</div>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the scout-master found himself drawing near
the spot where he had had his former interesting
meeting with little Conrad, he listened with eagerness
to catch the first faint notes from the quavering
strings of the wonderful violin that had once
been in the possession of Ovid Anderson.</p>

<p>"I'm no judge of such instruments myself,"
Elmer had told his chums when speaking of the
matter, "but I expect that violin must be a valuable
piece of polished wood. It certainly had an
extra sweet singing tone to me, and seemed to just
<i>talk</i> as the boy drew his bow over the strings. I
wouldn't be surprised now if it turned out to be
a Stradivarius or a Cremona, which I understand
represent the finest makes of violins known to the
profession."</p>

<p>When George seemed inclined to scoff at the
idea, since such an instrument was likely to be
worth thousands of dollars, and would have been
sold long ago to get common necessities, Elmer
had also told him that perhaps the daughter of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the famous player would have parted with her
soul before allowing that remembrance of her
father leave her house.</p>

<p>Then Elmer caught the first faint sound of
music. It thrilled him as he continued to hurry
forward, and the sounds became stronger. Yes,
and sure enough, there was lacking now some of
that sadness he had detected in the playing of Conrad
on the preceding day. Doubtless hope filled
the aspiring heart of the lad. His talk with his
mother may have given him new zeal, and the rainbow
of promise was arching his heaven even then
as he played, and waited for his new friend to
appear.</p>

<p>"That sounds more like it," Elmer told himself,
"and shows what a creature of circumstances a
genius must always be. Even this child makes
the music he finds in his own soul. But it's sweeter
by far than what he played yesterday, for there is
the breath of hope and promise in every note."</p>

<p>He soon came in sight of the familiar stump,
and found the lad curled up there as before, with
his violin tucked under his chin; just as though
he might be to the manner born, while his deft
right hand wielded the bow so tenderly that the
daintiest sort of sound came forth at his command.</p>

<p>But he was watching at the same time, and no
sooner did Elmer appear than the playing
abruptly ceased, while the boy came running to
meet him. Elmer then felt sorry that he had not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
remained in concealment a while longer, so that
he might have enjoyed more of that crude but
appealing music.</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm glad to see you again, Elmer!" exclaimed
the boy, as he held out his hand, which
the other did not attempt to squeeze too roughly,
for he remembered that those little digits had to
retain their sensitiveness to a remarkable degree
in order to coax persuasive notes to come forth.</p>

<p>"But before we do any talking," said Elmer,
"you must let me hear you play again. I notice
that you are in a more joyous mood today, for
it shows in your music. Please sit on your stump
again, Conrad, and humor me for a while. Afterwards
we can have a nice long chat; and I'm meaning
to ask a great favor of you later."</p>

<p>The boy's eyes flashed with genuine pleasure. It
was evidently a treat for him to have an audience
besides the squirrels and rabbits, with perhaps a
curious old red fox that, prowling around in
search of a dinner, may have stopped to investigate
the origin of those queer squeaks and twirls,
and those sobbing notes, so like a hen partridge
clucking to her brood.</p>

<p>For possibly ten minutes or so he played with
scarcely any intermission. Elmer thought he
could never tire of drinking in the sweet combinations
of sounds which that deft little hand
tempted from the five strings of the violin. It
seemed as though the spirit of the old <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'virtuosa'">virtuoso</ins> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
must haunt the sacred instrument, and give forth
some of his choicest chords through the medium
of his descendant, heir to his undoubted genius.</p>

<p>And it also seemed as though the lad's power
to delineate the sounds that appealed to him from
the woods and waters was unlimited, for he seldom
repeated as he went on, making up astonishing
strain after strain.</p>

<p>Elmer was more than satisfied now his first
impression had not been wrong. He felt doubly
convinced that all this lad needed to develop into
one of the greatest players the world had ever
known was the directing hand of a master, who
could guide him past the rocks on which his young
talent might be wrecked if not taken in time.</p>

<p>"Now, that is enough for today," said Conrad,
suddenly allowing his hand holding the bow to
drop; "I never try to play when something inside
tells me to stop. And I'm eager to tell you something
good. My mother wants to meet you,
Elmer."</p>

<p>This intelligence caused the scout-master to
smile with pleasure.</p>

<p>"Why," he exclaimed eagerly, "do you know,
that was the favor I meant when I said I wanted
to ask you something. I have been wishing I could
meet the mother of my new little friend; for I am
sure she must be a remarkable woman."</p>

<p>"So she is," stoutly asserted Conrad, faithful
little soul; "and the best mother there ever could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
be. All I know she has taught me, for, you see,
she used to be a school teacher once, after grandfather
died, and the money was lost."</p>

<p>"You told her about me, then?" asked Elmer.</p>

<p>"Why, of course; I tell her everything that happens
to me!" Conrad declared, simply. "I couldn't
have a secret from my mother, could I? And you
ought to have seen how her eyes sparkled when
she heard what you said about seeing I had a
chance to learn the many things I ought to know
about using a violin properly. Why, Elmer, I
guess it must have been the wish of her heart, that
some one would come along and say that; because
she took me in her arms and hugged me, yes, and
she cried some, too, I know she did, for I felt hot
tears on my cheek; but then it must have been
because she was so happy, for she laughed ever so
hard right afterwards."</p>

<p>Elmer himself was deeply affected. He could
picture that loving mother, possessed of the knowledge
that the fires of genius burned in the soul of
her child, and each night praying that in due time
the opportunity might come for that to be developed
into a glorious flame; and how overcome she
might be on realizing that the one great wish of
her whole life seemed about to be realized.</p>

<p>They talked on for quite a long while. Conrad
with a child's natural curiosity asked many questions
about the outside world, of which he had seen
so little of recent years, since his father seemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
to want to get away from all mankind. Elmer
told him many things that excited his interest.
Then finally he mentioned the fact that time was
passing, and before a great while he would have
to think of returning to his chums at the camp.</p>

<p>"I'd like very much to meet your good mother
before I go back, Conrad," he suggested, at which
the lad seized his hand and began to lead him off.</p>

<p>"So you shall," he remarked, briskly, "and I
know she's waiting for me to fetch you over, because
she told me to be sure and do so. You'll
like my mother, Elmer, I know you will."</p>

<p>Elmer could understand why a mother should
be anxious to meet one who had made such a vast
promise to her boy, and which might mean so
much in shaping his destiny.</p>

<p>"She wants to size me up," he told himself, with
a satisfied smile, as he walked along at the side
of the chattering boy; "she wants to see if I look
like a vain boaster, or one she could trust. Well,
I hope I don't disappoint her, that's all."</p>

<p>Any one who knew Elmer Chenowith well could
have assured that anxious mother she could place
the most implicit trust in a boy built after his type;
his word was as good as his bond any day in his
home town; and that is where they know a boy
best of all.</p>

<p>Pretty soon they sighted a cabin through the
trees. Smoke was coming from the chimney, made
of slabs, and hard mud that had gained the consistency<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
of cement by the drying process. Elmer
smiled when he saw that it was of the same blue
consistency as the thin column that had caught
his attention on the preceding morning, and caused
him to stroll that way later on. Yes, and he could
catch the incense of burning hickory, than which
there cannot be anything more delicious in the nostrils
of a real fire-worshipper such as Elmer.</p>

<p>Their coming must have been noticed, for
quickly a form appeared in the open doorway. It
was that of a small woman, evidently Conrad's
mother, for the boy quickly waved his violin toward
her, and called out joyously:</p>

<p>"Here he is, mother; I've brought Elmer home
with me to meet you, just as I promised I would!"</p>

<p>She greeted the scout warmly, and asked him inside
where it was cool, out of the sun. Elmer felt
rather than saw her eyes fixed eagerly on his face.
Apparently Conrad's mother must have been
more than satisfied with what she saw there, for
she looked very contented, and even happy.</p>

<p>They were soon chatting as though the best of
friends. Elmer told her about his home, and how
he felt positive there were several well-to-do people
in the town, lovers of good music, who would,
if only they could hear Conrad play, be delighted
to make up a generous purse and see that the
grandson of so famous a man as Ovid Anderson
was placed under the proper teacher in New York.</p>

<p>He also told about the father of one of his comrades<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
having sent a girl abroad to have her voice
cultivated, and how after she came to sing in
opera, and turned out to be a great star, she had
insisted on returning every cent he had expended
on her, so that he might pass it along to some
other poor girl or boy who had the gift of music,
without the opportunity to accomplish results
through lack of means.</p>

<p>Elmer was too wise to mention that name of
Snodgrass when telling this; he feared that it
might be too much like flaunting a red flag before
a bull; for if Mrs. Shock shared Jem's antipathy
for the Snodgrass clan, she would likely decline
to let Conrad profit by such generosity.</p>

<p>It was plain to be seen that what he said interested
her greatly. She told him more or less of
her hopes and fears concerning the prodigy over
whose future such clouds of uncertainty hung.
Elmer sympathized with her, too, and quite won
her heart by his manner; but then that was not
an unusual thing with the scout leader, who by
Nature had been gifted with a winning way that
gained him hosts of loyal friends.</p>

<p>A little to the boy's surprise, too, she even ventured
to speak of herself. Naturally she must
have guessed that his curiosity would be aroused
on finding the daughter of a famous man mated
with one whom people deigned to look down on,
and even shun, though, for that matter, Jem Shock
wanted none of their society.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>"They do not know him as Conrad and I do,"
she went on, hastily, after introducing the subject
of her own accord. "I first met him away up in
the mountains. After my father died, and the
property was taken from me through an error in
his will, I taught school for some years to gain
a living. Then, one fall when I was in the Adirondacks,
it chanced that a dreadful forest fire
swept down from every side. I was caught in the
midst of it, and I had given up all hope of surviving;
when <i>he</i> came and took me up in his arms.
Somehow I seemed to feel that all would be well.
Oh! how strong he was, and how he braved every
sort of peril in order to carry me safely through.
It was then and there that my heart went out to
him. And afterwards we were married. He has
always been the same to me, tender and kind;
though latterly his life has been soured through
the treachery of one whom he trusted."</p>

<p>She stopped there, sighed, and looked sad.
Elmer would have liked very much to know how
they came to be there near Raccoon Bluff, which,
by a strange twist of Fate, had recently come into
the possession of the very man against whom Jem
Shock believed he had such a grievance. It was
too delicate a subject, however, for him to attempt
to handle; she must tell him, if at all, through her
own volition, Elmer concluded.</p>

<p>But somehow it did him good to hear such fine
things said of the rough Jem; for it coincided with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
his belief that one cannot always tell from the
exterior what may be within the shell. If only
now Rufus could discover that it had all been a
grievous mistake, and that his father would give
anything to make amends for the unfortunate past,
how delightful things would be.</p>

<p>So Elmer, as he continued to talk with the little
lady&mdash;for she was that in every sense, although
her dress may have been of the cheapest material,
and there was a painful lack of many comforts in
her modest cabin home&mdash;came to know her as well
as if he had met her long before. Glimpses of her
life, her hopes and fears were constantly passing
before his mental observation; and he was more
than glad now that he had taken that notion to
walk in the direction of the blue smoke wreaths
eddying upward in the lazy morning air several
miles distant.</p>

<p>Conrad had put his beloved violin carefully
away. It could be seen that his whole heart was
tied up in that precious instrument. Elmer, remembering
the dispute he had had with unbelieving
George, asked about the violin, and whether
it was really the former possession of the lad's
famous grandfather.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is true," she told him, sighing again.
"He used it all of his last years of playing. It
shared some of his most wonderful triumphs, and
he loved it as the apple of his eye. It is a genuine
Stradivarius instrument. I could have sold it for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
thousands of dollars, since it had once been his
means of fascinating untold myriads of music
lovers; but that would have killed me. It is all
I have left to remember him by; and besides, something
told me when Conrad came that he was destined
to inherit the talent."</p>

<p>Just then Elmer saw the boy spring down from
his seat close beside his mother. At the same
time he heard the sound of a heavy footfall, and
guessed what that meant. Jem Shock was coming
home. How would he greet one of the boys from
the camp where that son of the man he had such
cause for hating held forth? Elmer stood up.
If he felt the least tremor in the region of his
heart, he certainly gave no sign of this, for his
face was wreathed in one of his most genial smiles
as he waited for the poacher to appear.</p>

<p>Then a form darkened the open doorway, and
with a shout Conrad rushed forward, to be gathered
up in the arms of Jem Shock, and held tight
to his breast. And seeing this Elmer somehow
could not doubt but that it was all bound to come
out right in the end, no matter what clouds might
drift across the sky meanwhile.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>WHEN THE STORM BROKE</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Jem Shock discovered that he and his
wife and boy were not alone in the cabin his manner
instantly changed. Elmer saw the heavy brow
knit, as though in sudden suspicion. He remembered
that this man distrusted all his fellows, and
that he had even defied the majesty of the law
with regard to shooting wild game out of season,
as well as catching fish by methods called illegal.</p>

<p>His manner of life would make him scan with
suspicious eyes any stranger who came to his
isolated cabin home, and who might just as well
as not be some clever game warden, bent on securing
evidence that would convict him.</p>

<p>"This is Elmer, and he is the good friend who
promised to see that I got a chance to play my
violin the proper way," said Conrad, with a dignity
that would well have become a grown man.</p>

<p>As he spoke, he took the young scout-master by
the hand and led him a pace or two forward. Elmer
tried to be most cordial. He wanted to win
the good will of this man, for many reasons. First,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
there was Conrad, and his possible brilliant future,
if his amazing genius could be placed under the
fostering care of a master. Then there was Elmer's
belief that Jem had been badly treated by
the whims of Fortune, and possibly the greed of
some man; he needed a friend if ever any one did.</p>

<p>So Elmer held out his hand as he advanced.
He also smiled warmly, as if to chase away that
look of distrust he could see gathering on Jem's
strong face.</p>

<p>"We have met before, Jem, on the road, while
our party was on the way up here," he went on
to say in as cordial a tone as he could muster.
"You remember I said then I hoped to see something
more of you, and invited you to stop in and
have a cup of coffee with us, in case you happened
to be passing our camp. And now that I have
made the acquaintance of Conrad and your good
wife, I hope we can be friends, Jem."</p>

<p>The man still continued to frown. Under his
heavy eyebrows he was looking keenly at the
speaker. Elmer's manner was surely enough to
disarm suspicion; and doubtless he would have
quite won the man over then and there only for
one thing. This was the presence of a boy in the
party bearing that unfortunate name of Snodgrass;
and which seemed to represent everything
that was evil, in the estimation of the poacher.</p>

<p>So Jem did not make the first move to take the
extended hand. If he had suspected the other to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
be ready to suddenly snap a pair of handcuffs on
his wrists, he could not have held more aloof.</p>

<p>"I'm not making friends with anybody these
days," he managed to mutter, "leastways when
they are so thick with the son of the man who sold
me out and left me high and dry on the bank."</p>

<p>"But the rest of us never heard of you before,
Jem; and even Rufus says it must be some terrible
mistake, because his father would never do such a
mean trick, even if he is a real-estate operator.
But, Jem, I want to be friends with you just because
of Conrad here. It would be a burning
shame if he didn't get his chance to prove that
his grandfather's talent is running in his blood.
I am sure that I'll be able to interest some really
good people, all of them lovers of the best music,
in Conrad; and that arrangements can be made
to put him under the charge of a leading teacher,
who will see that he has a chance to thrill the
world, when he grows older."</p>

<p>The man's face lighted up for just a brief interval.
Perhaps he had dreamed of some day seeing
Conrad the centre of a madly applauding
throng of well-dressed people, who would be ready
to crown the lad as the greatest genius of the
decade. Then the old doubts returned again, and
he scowled darkly.</p>

<p>"We may be poor," he said bitterly, "which
isn't my fault, but my misfortune; yet we're not
paupers; and even to see my boy snatch the prize<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
he deserves I wouldn't beg money from any living
man or woman. I'll die before I accept <i>charity</i>.
If I had my just dues there would be plenty of
money to fix Conrad out; as it is he must wait,
and take his chance."</p>

<p>"But, Jem, this wouldn't be charity," Elmer
insisted, earnestly. "It could be done on strictly
business principles, a bargain being made in black
and white, so that a record of the expense might
be kept; and after Conrad began to earn big
money, he could gradually return the loan to those
kind friends who had been so deeply interested
in his fortunes. Don't shut him out from his only
chance, Jem, just because one man may have injured
you. There are other kinds of people in
this world, kind-hearted people who are always
looking for an opportunity to help struggling
genius. Oh! please don't decide in a hurry. Think
it over, talk it over with your wife here before you
turn the offer down; because it is given in good
faith, Jem."</p>

<p>Mrs. Shock listened, and her eyes grew moist.
She apparently did not think it wise to interfere
while a stranger was present, but Elmer believed
her influence was bound to be thrown in favor of
the proposition. Therefore he did not quite despair,
though the poacher continued to shake his
head, and keep his teeth firmly clenched, after the
manner of a stubborn man who has made up his
mind, and against whom all power cannot prevail.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>You see, Elmer, young though he may have been,
was somewhat of a philosopher. He knew that
gentle influence may sometimes accomplish much
more than the most sturdy strength. He had
never forgotten the moral of that old story about
the traveler who was trudging along a country
road, when the two rival elements, the Sun and
the Wind, entered into a heated argument as to
which might be the more powerful, and determined
to test their assertions upon the devoted head of
the pilgrim. So the wind blew harder and harder,
but only had the effect of making the traveler
draw his cloak tighter about him. Then the sun
has his turn, and began to warm up to his task,
until the almost baked man was glad to throw off
his cloak, which result gave the victory to the
heavenly orb.</p>

<p>And so perhaps the gentle but persuasive influence
of Conrad's mother might in the end prevail
against the wild gusts of the man's anger. Elmer
at least would continue to hug that hope to his
heart.</p>

<p>He saw that his continued presence would do no
further good. It were perhaps better that he took
himself off, and allowed the seed he had sown to
germinate. Time can often work wonders, and the
look Mrs. Shock gave him somehow further
aroused his confidence that all might yet be well.</p>

<p>So he said he would be going, and the last he
saw of them Conrad was waving his hand in farewell,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
while his mother nodded her head significantly.
As for Jem, he continued to stand there
looking glum, as though a riot of thoughts might
be holding high carnival in his brain, the old suspicion
and hatred for mankind engaged in a desperate
conflict with newly awakened hopes.</p>

<p>Elmer made his way back to camp, and arrived
long before noon came, so that he had plenty of
time to rest and think over the situation. He
wondered whether he had succeeded in making
any progress by his morning's expedition. He had
met Jem, for one thing, and told him how much
he was interested in Conrad's playing. Yes, Elmer
concluded that the game he meant to play
had been advanced more or less since the coming
of another day.</p>

<p>The surveyors came trooping into camp along
about noon, heated and tired. Rufus was apparently
getting quite enough of that hard work, for
the time being. Besides, he admitted that he had
gone sufficiently far by then to make sure that the
previous survey had been a failure, and that the
job would have to be done over again in order
to get the right lines.</p>

<p>Elmer was not sorry to hear him say that, and
for several reasons. First of all, he wanted the
tenderfeet to have further opportunities for picking
up more or less useful knowledge of woodcraft,
while in camp; and this could not be done if most
of their time was spent in using those instruments,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and worrying about backing new lines through
the thickets and swamps that beset their course.</p>

<p>Then again Elmer did not like the looks of the
weather. It was beginning to act suspiciously,
as though a big storm might be brewing. The
sun still shone up there in the sky, and both Rufus
and Alec only thought it insufferably hot; but to
one more experienced in such things, there was a
deeper meaning in the heavy atmosphere, the
strange silence on the part of birds and smaller
animals, and the peculiar bank of clouds that lay
low along the distant southwestern horizon.</p>

<p>Lil Artha sensed danger, too, for he spoke of
it as they were eating lunch.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, Elmer," was the way he put it, "we'd
be sensible if we took an extra reef or two in our
sail this afternoon, while we have the chance.
An ounce of prevention is better than a pound
of cure, I always did believe; and scouts are
taught that it's wise in time of peace to prepare
for war."</p>

<p>"Hey! what's all this talk mean?" demanded
the bewildered Rufus. "To hear you, Lil Artha,
a fellow would think we had something terrible
hanging over our heads. It must be you're prognosticating
a <i>storm</i>, but I don't see what makes
you think that, when the sun never shone brighter.
Do the birds carry the secret, and have you fellows
found a way to understand their lingo?"</p>

<p>"Well, in a way that's correct, too, Rufus,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
chuckled the lanky scout. "When you get on familiar
terms with everything that lives in the
woods, you can tell a heap. It does seem that
insects, birds and animals are given instinct in
place of reasoning powers. So the squirrel knows
when it promises to be a severe winter, and he
lays in an extra big store of nuts. And in the
same way something warns these little creatures
when a storm is coming, although human beings
see no sign. Well, from the change that's taken
place all around us we scouts can give a good
guess that these same birds and insects are making
ready for trouble; and it's bound to come from
that quarter yonder, where you can see a bank of
dark clouds hugging the horizon."</p>

<p>"But, Lil Artha," protested Alec, strenuously,
"I noticed yon bank o' clouds mair nor two hours
back, and I gie ye my word it hasn't moved a
wee bit in a' that time."</p>

<p>"Oh! that's often the way a storm comes along,"
the other assured him, in a positive fashion, as
though he had no doubt concerning the accuracy
of his prediction. "Clouds will lie low for half
a day, and then suddenly with a shift of the wind
spread out over the whole heavens like magic. I
promise you that before two hours have gone by
you'll be stopping your ears with your fingers so's
to shut out the crash of thunder."</p>

<p>Of course, as both Elmer and George seemed to
agree with what Lil Artha said&mdash;and it was really<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
wonderful to have "Doubting George" let an opportunity
to object pass him by, the greenhorns
had to believe what they heard.</p>

<p>When lunch had been disposed of, Elmer gave
orders that set the whole five working to improve
the security of the camp. Extra pegs were driven
deep down so as to hold the tent more firmly; and
some bits of strong rope were also brought into
play with this same end in view.</p>

<p>Rufus could not restrain his amusement, and
finally burst out with:</p>

<p>"Well, from the way you're carrying on, fellows,
it must be you expect a regular old hurricane
to break loose in this region. I guess it would
take a whole lot of wind to tear that tent loose
from its moorings now. Besides, we're sheltered
somewhat by those trees over yonder."</p>

<p>"Wait and see, that's all," warned Lil Artha,
not one whit abashed. "You've never been caught
in a big storm, and so you can't know how the
wind tears at a tent as if it had a special spite
against the canvas. I've seen more'n one tent carried
away like a big balloon, and lodged far up in
a tree. This is only following out the scout rule
of preparedness. It's better to err on the side
of safety, Rufus; just remember that as you pass
along the road. It's no sign of timidity to get
ready for trouble; the wisest of business men always
insure their property, and when the storm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
comes they weather it, where the more reckless
go to the wall."</p>

<p>"That's sound logic, Lil Artha," commented
Elmer, smiling to hear the other give such splendid
advice; for, as a rule, the lengthy scout was
a bit inclined toward that same recklessness
himself.</p>

<p>In many other ways did they prepare for the
coming storm, particularly in seeing that a small
stock of wood was placed so that it might be kept
dry; since they might be glad of a fire later on.
Their stock of provisions, too, had to be provided
for; and Rufus also covered the old car with a
tarpaulin which he had fetched along for that
purpose.</p>

<p>During the last half hour of work even the most
skeptical found himself forced to admit that there
was no longer any doubt about the approach of bad
weather. As the dark bank of clouds advanced up
the heavens the birds again made their appearance,
and flew wildly about, uttering warning cries
that impressed Rufus visibly.</p>

<p>Then they began to hear distant muttering of
heavy thunder that was soon causing a distinctly
felt vibration of the earth under their feet. The
wind had entirely ceased, and there seemed to be
an ominous calm upon Nature. Rufus and Alec
had an apprehensive expression on their faces as
they waited for further developments.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it might be safer over among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the trees than here, Elmer?" asked Rufus at one
time, after the thunder had temporarily died
away.</p>

<p>"Not on your life!" burst out Lil Artha, taking
it on himself to answer. "If the gale gets half as
severe as I expect, you'll hear trees crashing down
like toothpicks. It'd be all your life was worth
to be caught in the woods then. An experienced
hand might manage to escape, but often the best of
them get caught under a falling tree and killed
outright. That's one reason why we built our
camp away from all trees but this dwarf one that
isn't apt to go down, and serves as a sort of wind-<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'brake'">break</ins>,
you see. But listen, everybody!"</p>

<p>A distant but terrifying sound stole to their
ears. The lack of a movement in the atmosphere
had prevented them from catching it sooner.</p>

<p>"Is that the storm coming?" asked Rufus, trying
to keep his voice steady, though there was a distinct
quaver to it, despite his efforts.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's the wind, and back of it is the first
burst of rain," advised Elmer. "It will be on us
in a jiffy now, so we'd better get inside, and lace
the opening up. We faced the tent to the north
purposely, you see, because we knew that any
storm at this time of year was likely to jump out
of the southwest."</p>

<p>Hardly had they made the flap secure when the
gale broke upon them.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SCOTCH BLOOD</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> other things, Lil Artha had seen to it
that a pot of coffee was made ready just before
he scattered the fire, and put out the last ember.
This would keep warm for a long time, and they
could manage to make out a supper with some
of the things that would not need cooking.</p>

<p>With a rush and a roar the storm burst upon
them. Wildly did the stout tent sway as the wind
broke against it. Rufus understood speedily
enough why the scout comrades who had had experience
went to so much extra pains to fasten
it so securely. There were lots of times when, despite
all the precautions, he feared the canvas
could never hold out against that terrible wind
that made playthings of forest monarchs, and
seemed capable of sweeping everything from its
path.</p>

<p>Never, so long as they lived, would the two tenderfoot
scouts forget that night; it would always
be marked with a white stone in their minds, such
were the tortures they endured. Often Rufus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
would half squirm to his knees, his face turned
pale with apprehension, as he clutched the sleeve
of Elmer or Lil Artha's coat, in deadly fear that
the worst was about to happen.</p>

<p>The rain descended in torrents, and the lightning
flashed in a way to fairly cause them to shut
their blinded eyes; while terrific bursts of thunder
rocked the ground and made them think a salvo
from the heaviest guns known to modern warfare
was being fired.</p>

<p>So the time dragged wearily along, hour after
hour. No one dreamed of trying to snatch a wink
of sleep while this din was going on. They sat
there, glad to know that, thanks to the admirable
way in which the heavy canvas had been waterproofed,
and the addition of a fly over the tent,
they were able to keep the rain out. Of course a
small amount did seep under certain portions of
the tent, despite all their precautions, and the
drain that had been dug above to carry the flood
off; but they were able to keep pretty dry, all
things considered.</p>

<p>With the storm came a cool air that chilled them
to the bone. They had a couple of lanterns, one of
which was kept lighted all the time, and this enabled
them to see what was going on. Lil Artha
set a good example, after night came on, by wrapping
his warm blanket about his shoulders, as he
sat there Indian fashion. Rufus was indeed glad
to copy this example, and found it well worth while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
for the additional comfort he secured thereby;
and in the end all of them did the same thing.</p>

<p>Every now and then they heard awe-inspiring
sounds that Lil Artha told the tenderfeet were
produced by falling trees. Each crash gave Rufus
cause for a fresh shiver; he could not help thinking
of what he had proposed concerning their being
likely to find more safety if they took up their
station under the forest growth. He was glad
now in every atom of his being that those more
experienced scouts had frowned down upon such
a silly proposition.</p>

<p>Along about midnight, however, Elmer discovered
positive signs that the worst was over. His
announcement brought a feeling of relief to Rufus
and Alec; indeed, even Lil Artha was heard to give
expression to his gratitude. George, however,
grumbled, as was his habit of old.</p>

<p>"Tough luck, that's what I call it, fellows," he
went on, as though wholly disgusted with the
freaks of the weather. "Why couldn't this old
storm have held off till we got back home again?
What business did it have coming down on us right
in the midst of our camping? Why, we haven't
begun to enjoy ourselves much yet; it's been all
work so far; and now everything's going to be
soaking wet, the mud'll bother us, and like as not
a second rain'll follow the first. Things pretty
nearly always do happen in threes, you notice."</p>

<p>"Oh! well, we're all alive, George, for one thing,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Lil Artha told the grumbler. "And we've still got
heaps and heaps of good stuff to eat along. Things
might have been a whole lot worse than this, let
me tell you."</p>

<p>"Huh! I can't just see that," continued the other,
though in a fainter tone, as if really half ashamed
of his complaining manner; which had become second
nature with George, so that he often spoke
in that way without thinking how badly it sounded.</p>

<p>"If only this terrible storm will stop, all would
be forgiven," said Rufus. "We may get a few
winks of sleep yet before dawn comes. And I
guess the ground will dry up pretty well by noon.
Besides, I'm done creeping through the woods and
among the thickets, trying to follow those slashes
made by the fake surveyors. We can lie around
camp here, until it's fit to go abroad."</p>

<p>"Spoken like a true scout, Rufus," Elmer told
him, encouragingly. "That's what a fellow ought
to learn the first thing after he dons the khaki&mdash;that
things are never so bad but what they might
be worse. George here never did learn his lesson
in the right way, more's the pity. If you keep on,
Rufus, you'll be a better specimen of a true scout
than George is today, with all his experience."</p>

<p>George did not say anything, but Elmer hoped
the seed might have fallen on fallow ground, so
that it would take root and grow; for there were
times when, like most of the other fellows in the
Hickory Ridge Troop, he did get mightily tired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
of hearing the remarks of a natural-born
"croaker," as Lil Artha called the other.</p>

<p>But Elmer was right when he said the backbone
of the storm had been broken. Inside of another
half hour even Rufus was fain to admit that the
thunder had lost considerable of its fierceness,
while even the flashes of lightning came less frequently,
nor were they so vivid as before.</p>

<p>"The rain has stopped, fellows!" announced Lil
Artha, as he sidled along over to one side of the
tent, and cautiously began to undo the securely
fastened flap; after which he thrust his head out
so as to take an observation.</p>

<p>When he drew back again the others eagerly
awaited his report.</p>

<p>"Why, the clouds are breaking, and I even saw a
star right overhead," announced the tall member
of the little party, enthusiastically; "which proves
that the end of the concert is close by. That last
thunder-clap was some distance away. Guess we
may be getting a little snooze inside of another
half hour. For one I'm going to hunt out a dry
place and make ready."</p>

<p>There was considerable of a scurry on the part
of everybody, with this end in view. Rufus was
heard to wish most ardently that he had still another
blanket to huddle under, for that night air,
after the violent battle of the elements, seemed
to be very chilly and piercing, since they could
not enjoy the luxury of a fire.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, in spite of all this, when another
hour had crept along all of the boys were sound
asleep. No longer did the harsh voice of the thunder
disturb them; and the fitful glow of lightning
came from far off. The lantern had been extinguished,
for they might need what small allowance
of kerosene they had fetched along with them; and
therefore darkness reigned within the sheltering
tent.</p>

<p>They had some hours of sleep before morning
found them stirring. There was more or less disinclination
to be the first out, but Lil Artha proved
to be the martyr and presently the crackle of a
fire tempted Rufus and Alec forth; while even that
sly old fox, George, opened one eye, and began
to sniff the air, as though he fancied he had gotten
the first whiff of sweet bacon frying in the pan.</p>

<p>Elmer had been close upon the heels of Lil
Artha, of course, and between the two of them
some of the ravages of the storm in the camp had
been repaired long before the rest put in an appearance.</p>

<p>A warm and bountiful breakfast seemed to put
new animation in them all. Even that born grumbler,
George, admitted the sun did shine "fairly
well," and that coffee, bacon and flapjacks with
syrup, all served lavishly as regarded quantity,
made life worth living again.</p>

<p>"I don't believe I was ever so hungry as this
morning," Rufus candidly declared, as he gulped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
down his third cup of coffee, and eyed the last
flapjack as if tempted to gorge himself, though
already as full as prudence dictated.</p>

<p>"That's because so far in life you've lived on
Easy Street," Lil Artha told him, "and never have
known what it meant to miss a single meal. Some
of us have gone a day without a bite, and we know
how it goes on an empty stomach. I warrant you
right now some woods animals are feeling that
way too, because they couldn't get around last
night as usual."</p>

<p>It was strange that this casual remark on the
part of Lil Artha should be fully confirmed before
a great while had passed, and in a most convincing
fashion.</p>

<p>Alec chanced to be the one fated to bring the
thing about. None of them meant to wander away
from camp until noon had come, and the warm sun
had had a chance to dry things out; but being a
little restless, and, moreover, inspired with a desire
to ascertain if any of those ill-fated trees had
fallen close to the camp, he picked up a heavy
walking stick and stepped out.</p>

<p>"Be sure you don't go farther than you can hear
Lil Artha chopping with the ax," cautioned
Elmer, seeing him about to take a stroll; "and if
you fail to catch any sound, or need help, just give
a whoop. We'll answer right away."</p>

<p>"Hoot, mon," said the Scotch lad, a bit sarcastically,
"d'ye ken I've cut me eye-teeth the while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
as a scout? I'm observing all aboot me, and I find
it mair interesting than I ever believed could be
possible. I'm o'er glad now I made up my mind
to join the troop. Now I'll gang awa' and be verra
careful. And if some fearsome beastie jumps up
in front o' me ye'll hear me shout at the tap o'
my voice."</p>

<p>He went away, still laughing, as though he
thought it a good joke. Lil Artha continued to ply
his ax industriously, meaning to lay by a good
store of firewood while at the job; though Elmer
warned him that task should really fall to the
greenhorns, since neither of them seemed to be
much of a cook, and it was only fair the various
duties about the camp should be impartially
shared alike by all the party.</p>

<p>Hardly had ten minutes passed when the four
by the fire heard a shout. Elmer instantly answered
it, thinking, of course, that as Lil Artha
had dropped his ax Alec wanted some sound to
serve as a guide to locating the camp. To the
astonishment, and also consternation of the others,
they heard the Scotch lad calling:</p>

<p>"Here's a hungry cat facing me, and growling
like everything. Aye, but he's wild to get at me,
and I don't know just what a braw scout should
do under the circumstances. Shall I gi'e the gillie
a rap o'er the head wi' me stick; or beat a retreat
like a wise general? I'm no' so taken wi' his looks
I confess that I'm wishin' to make his further<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
acquaintance. Hey; ye would bite me, eh? Tak'
that, then, and learn better manners!"</p>

<p>Elmer snatched up another stick, while Lil
Artha darted over to the tent and immediately
reappeared bearing his trusty Marlin. They knew
what it meant to be attacked by an angry bobcat,
even if it was far in the morning, and these animals
usually hide during the better part of the
day, preferring the shades of night for their
prowling.</p>

<p>Even as the pair started toward the spot, followed
in turn by George and Rufus, as soon as
the others could manage to find some sort of crude
weapon, they heard a most terrific crashing going
on. There were also short cries, now of pain and
again of momentary triumph, to tell how Alec was
progressing in his task of beating off the savage
attack of the hungry wildcat.</p>

<p>There was no trouble in locating the spot where
all this disturbance was taking place; the scuffling
of Alec's feet, his jerky cries, and now and then
a plainly heard snarl from the enraged cat led
them as truly as the magnetic needle of the mariner's
compass points out the North Star.</p>

<p>When they finally came in sight of the little
woods drama they were thrilled to see how the
brave Scotch lad managed to keep his four-footed
enemy at bay by means of his clever strokes with
his stick. Even as they looked he gave the beast
a good blow upon the head that rolled it over; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
instantly the cat was on its feet once more, and
leaping at him. The performance was repeated,
with the same result; but in case Alec failed in
his stroke, he stood a good chance of having the
animal land on his breast, when its claws and
teeth would do terrible damage.</p>

<p>"Get the beast, Lil Artha!" cried Elmer, seeing
that even their bursting on the scene did not appear
to intimidate the enraged feline adversary
that Alec was battling with.</p>

<p>He had hardly given the word than a report
sounded. Lil Artha had once been quite a smart
hunter, though of late his ambition to excel along
those lines had waned. On this occasion his aim
was particularly true, for the cat was seen to be
writhing on the ground, as though fatally injured.
Lil Artha immediately ran up and dispatched the
dying beast with several blows from a stone; for
although a hunter by instinct, Lil Artha could not
be cruel and see anything needlessly suffer.</p>

<p>"I sure hated to have to do it the worst kind,"
he told Elmer, as he looked down at the now quiet
beast, ferocious even in death, "because I reckon
now she's got kits somewhere near by, which was
what made her act so savage like. She smelled
the food in camp, and was sneaking around in
hopes of stealing something, when Alec, he
chanced to run across her, and I guess waved his
stick in a way she didn't just like. But I had to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
shoot her, and you thought the same, Elmer, you
know."</p>

<p>"Yes, it couldn't be helped," the scout-master
told him, "and besides, a fellow need hardly ever
be ashamed of making way with a wildcat, because
they are mighty destructive to all game. Why,
this one beast would, in the course of a year, devour
more young partridges, quail, rabbits and
squirrels than half a dozen human hunters. And
besides, I was afraid she might get inside Alec's
guard, though he did swing that stick of his in
great fashion."</p>

<p>"A few scratches is all the beastie managed to
gi'e me," admitted the still panting Alec, and then,
as he looked down on his now quiet adversary, he
shook his head, continuing: "faith I tauld ye to
tak yersil' awa' and leave me alone, but ye knew
best. I'm awfu' sorry ye had to be kilt, but it was
no fault o' mine."</p>

<p>Elmer and Lil Artha exchanged satisfied
glances. They both felt that for a tenderfoot,
Alec had proven a credit to the troop, and this
was encouraging. After all, this outing seemed
bound to be the making of a couple of embryo
scouts; it would bring out whatever good qualities
they possessed, and show what sort of foundation
there might be for their immediate future.</p>

<p>"Come back to camp with me right away, Alec,"
Elmer told the other, who was still curiously examining
the dead cat, especially interested in its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
savage looking claws and the cruel teeth that were
exposed in the snarl that death had set upon its
face. "I want to take a look at those same little
scratches you mention. They may appear harmless
enough, but many a fine hunter has died from
such simple things."</p>

<p>Of course Alec was astounded. He stared hard
at his hands, and shook his head in a skeptical
way.</p>

<p>"I ha'e nae doot but that ye knaw best, Elmer,"
he finally said, "but would ye tell me the noo how
such a wee bit o' scratches could mean so much?"</p>

<p>"Blood poisoning is apt to set in," explained the
other, readily enough, as he locked arms with
the Scotch lad and hurried him off toward the
camp. "You see, carnivorous animals that live
upon the flesh of their prey are apt to have their
claws contaminated. Even a slight abrasion
caused by those claws is impregnated with just so
much danger. Nothing might come of it; but
scouts believe in taking as little chances as possible.
I've got a phial of permanganate of potash
along for just such purposes, and we'll daub some
of it on. You'll resemble a wild Indian with the
splotches, for it stains a deep purple, but safety
first before looks."</p>

<p>Indeed, Alec did look rather odd after his several
slight injuries had been duly attended to, for
Elmer did not spare the "painting."</p>

<p>"I wish me mither could see me the noo,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
chuckled the Scotch boy, after he had surveyed his
mottled appearance in a tiny hand mirror one of
them had been thoughtful enough to fetch along.
"Ye ken, she's often tauld me aboot the Highland
chiefs in their war-paint in the gude auld days of
lang syne. I warran ye she'd think her son and
heir had copied after the McGregor, Rob Roy, ye
remimber, our outlaw ancestor."</p>

<p>Lil Artha was to fetch along the defunct wildcat,
for it was designed to save the skin, and present
it, when properly tanned, to Alec, who could
use it in his den at home for a small mat. Every
time he looked down at it he must be forcibly
reminded of his stirring adventure, and it would
serve to encourage him in his endeavor to become
a first-class scout.</p>

<p>It was perhaps half an hour afterwards that
Elmer heard voices, and looking toward the spot
where Lil Artha had been working with the pelt
of the bobcat, he was both surprised and thrilled
to discover that the long-legged scout was talking
with a small party in whom Elmer immediately
recognized Conrad Shock!</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A CALL FOR HELP</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">What's</span> this mean?" Elmer heard George saying,
which proved that the other had also discovered
Conrad's presence. "I reckon that must be
your Boy Wonder with the fiddle and the bow,
Elmer. Now, whatever brought him away over
here to visit us, do you think? Perhaps his folks
don't know that scouts are at home in the woods,
no matter what sort of gay storm crops up.
Mebbe now they were afraid some of us had suffered.
Well, it was nice of them to send a messenger,
anyhow."</p>

<p>But Elmer was disposed to view the matter differently.
He could see that there was a look of
considerable apprehension visible on the peaked
face of Conrad. Elmer scented some kind of
trouble at once. The boy had sought them out,
possibly sent with a message by his mother.</p>

<p>Lil Artha had entirely suspended operations
with the pelt which he had been engaged in fastening
to a crude but effective stretching board,
fashioned after the directions he had received<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
from the old scientist and trapper some of the
boys had visited a while before.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>Lil Artha loved good music, in which he differed
from George. Hence he had felt considerable
interest in all Elmer told them about Conrad being
the direct descendant of the famous violinist, Ovid
Anderson, of whom he had often heard. He was
in truth quite eager himself to hear the child play,
though ready to take Elmer's word for it that
Conrad was the possessor of wonderful genius.</p>

<p>As Elmer hastened toward the spot Lil Artha
looked around and discovered him.</p>

<p>"Hi! here's your young friend come to hunt you
up, Elmer!" he called out. "He is just telling me
that his mother sent him. I hope now there's
nothing gone wrong over at their place. If we can
do anything, of course we'd be only too willing."</p>

<p>The boy shot him a look of gratitude at hearing
Lil Artha say this. Then he turned eagerly
toward Elmer.</p>

<p>"Mother sent me over to see you," he went on
to say in a voice that quivered a little despite his
manly effort to control his feelings.</p>

<p>"I hope she isn't sick, Conrad?" ventured the
scout-master, anxiously.</p>

<p>"No, it's father," the boy said after he had
gulped several times. "You see, he hasn't come
home; and we're so afraid something dreadful has
happened to him."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>
<p>Elmer looked doubly concerned.</p>

<p>"Do you mean he was away from home during
that awful storm last night?" he went on to ask.</p>

<p>The other nodded his head, and then managed
to explain further. Even the proximity of Elmer
seemed to have already done him much good; for
there was a certain atmosphere connected with
the resolute scout-leader that inspired the utmost
confidence.</p>

<p>"He started to go to the lake that is farthest
away, for there are two small ones, you may not
know," Conrad explained. "He had some set lines
there that needed attention, and we wanted the
fish for eating, too. But father backed out once,
for he said he had wrenched his leg and felt a
little lame. But in the end he decided to start,
though mother didn't just like him to go."</p>

<p>"About what time was that, Conrad?" asked
Elmer, in his methodical way, eager to grasp the
full details so he could figure out the answer.</p>

<p>"Just about an hour before the storm came
along," the boy told him. "Father said he believed
it would hold off long enough for him to
get there and back, but his leg must have kept him
from walking as fast as he generally does. So
the storm broke, and we kept watching through
the window when we could see anything, for the
rain and the flying leaves. But night came, and
oh! what a night we had, mother and I. It never
seemed to end. I did fall asleep somehow, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
I don't believe she once shut her eyes&mdash;poor
mother."</p>

<p>Elmer was fearful of the worst. A sturdy man
like Jem Shock, accustomed to buffeting the rough
storms to be met with in the woods of a summer,
was not likely to stay away from those he loved
unless something terrible had happened to him.
Elmer shivered as he remembered those dreadful
crashes in the depth of the forest, each signaling
the collapse of some mighty tree that had breasted
the gales of a century, perhaps, only to meet its
fate in the end.</p>

<p>"And then your mother thought we might help
find your father, did she?" asked the sympathetic
Lil Artha; while the others crowded around, listening
with white faces to the conversation; for
even the two tenderfeet could realize how serious
the conditions must prove to be.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is why I am here," said the manly
little fellow, whose correct manner of speech astonished
Lil Artha, himself apt to be more or less
"slangy," and even ungrammatical, in his careless
boyish way. "She knew of no one else close by
to turn to; and Elmer was so kind, she said. Oh!
please come with me, and help find father. We
are afraid that he was caught under one of the falling
trees; or he may have tripped in the darkness,
with that lame leg giving way under him, and
fallen into some terrible hole."</p>

<p>Elmer's mind was of course made up on the instant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Indeed, such an appeal never came to a
scout camp without being immediately accepted;
for every fellow who so proudly wears the khaki
has it implanted in his heart that he must eagerly
grasp such golden opportunities to prove his
worth, and be of assistance to those who are in
distress.</p>

<p>Elmer knew, too, that he could depend on his
comrades to back him up. Lil Artha, of course,
must go along, for the tall scout's excellence as
a tracker was well known, and this might come in
very handy before their end was accomplished.</p>

<p>Then it would be of more or less benefit to the
tenderfeet to have a share in his rescue work;
Elmer hailed the opportunity to increase their
fund of woodcraft knowledge with eagerness.
They could pick up more valuable points through
practical experience than by means of any books
or technical advice.</p>

<p>As for George, he must stay by the camp. Elmer
remembered just then that George had been
limping, more or less, and complained of having
stubbed his toe since breakfast. Then it would
be best for him not to walk so far, or he might be
lamed for the balance of their stay in camp.</p>

<p>The scout-master quickly explained his plan of
campaign. George, of course, frowned at first,
and took on the look of a martyr; but then that
was his customary way, and Elmer paid very little
attention to it except to say that "a stitch in time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
saves nine"; and that George might thank his
lucky stars he did not <i>have</i> to go along, but could
rest himself, and let that injured foot have a
chance to get well again.</p>

<p>Conrad was wild for them to get started, and
so Elmer lost as little time as possible. Before
he went, however, he made sure to carry along
with him several things he thought might be
needed in case they found Jem with a broken leg&mdash;he
only hoped it would be no worse than that, for
many a man had had his back broken by the fall
of a tree.</p>

<p>"Lil Artha, be sure not to forget the camp ax,"
he called out.</p>

<p>Of course that excited the curiosity of the two
greenhorns, and seeing the look of bewilderment
which they exchanged, Elmer took occasion to explain
just a little.</p>

<p>"If Jem has been badly hurt in any way, and
lies several miles away from home," Elmer told
them, "we would want to make some sort of
stretcher so as to carry him back to his cabin.
A hatchet or an ax is indispensable under such
conditions; and you may have a chance to see just
how it's done."</p>

<p>George saw them go away with a wry face, for
he did not like to be cheated out of any pleasure;
still, when he stepped around and found how his
foot hurt if he made any unusual exertion, he must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
have realized on second thoughts that Elmer knew
best.</p>

<p>Elmer had an idea at first of getting Conrad
to head toward home, when they were well upon
the trail leading toward the lake, and which the
boy had said he could show them. Upon suggesting
such a thing, however, he immediately met
with a prompt refusal.</p>

<p>"No, mother told me to take you to the second
lake, and I shall," Conrad said firmly. "Oh! I can
stand much more than you would believe; I am
stronger than I look. And I have been over the
trail with father, many times. What does a few
miles matter when father may be lying there,
and suffering terribly? Besides, mother depends
on me to take you there. What if you went alone
and could not find it, for, you see, it is hidden in
the woods, and not at all easy to see if you haven't
been over the trail before. He might lie there for
hours if that happened. So I must go."</p>

<p>Of course that settled it. Elmer could not have
the heart to deny the lad the privilege he demanded.
Besides, he knew that on the whole it
would be much better for them to have some one
along who was acquainted with the lay of the land.
They might go astray, experienced though two of
them were in the secrets of woodcraft; for confusing
trails might deceive them, especially after
the storm had washed away Jem's late footprints.</p>

<p>And so they hurried along. Little Conrad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
walked as though eager to even run; and more
than once Elmer had to restrain the anxious lad.
He saw that Conrad was worked up to a feverish
pitch that was not good for him; and accordingly
Elmer made it his business to try and reassure
the little fellow.</p>

<p>"Depend on it we'll find your father, Conrad,"
he went on to say in that steady tone of his that
carried weight, and could soothe even the most
troubled breast like "balm of Gilead," as Lil Artha
slily told Rufus, trotting along at his side.
"And the chances are a broken leg will be the extent
of his injuries. Why, he may not even be
so badly off as that, you know. Perhaps he was
called on to help some other unfortunate family
in that storm, and has been held up on that
account."</p>

<p>But Conrad sadly shook his wise little head.
He knew Elmer only meant to encourage him; and
that even he could have little hope such a strange
thing had happened.</p>

<p>"Oh! I'd like to believe that, Elmer," he said,
with half a sob, "but there is no other family near
enough for such a thing to happen. But I'm still
hoping for the best. Mother told me to keep thinking
that way. She will not believe he could be
taken away from us while we need him so much.
Yes, we must find him, poor, poor father!"</p>

<p>All this while they were heading in a certain
direction that Elmer knew would, in due time, unless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
they changed their course, take them to the
cabin in the clearing, where he had met Conrad's
father and mother.</p>

<p>Just as he expected, however, eventually the boy
brought them to a halt.</p>

<p>"See," he called out, as he pointed ahead,
"there is where the trail lies. One way is home,
the other the first lake, with the second one farther
away. Now we must keep right on, and listen
as we go. I shall call out, too, ever so often, for
if he hears my voice and can answer he will let
us know where he lies."</p>

<p>As they started to follow what was a plain trail,
every one had his senses on the alert, expecting
to make some sort of discovery sooner or later.
Rufus and the other tenderfoot scout were very
much excited. It was their first experience on
missionary work, and it gripped their hearts with
an intensity they may never have felt before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> step they took now was carrying them
on toward the twin lakes that nestled amidst the
woods and valleys, their presence really unsuspected
by the vast majority of people living in
towns within thirty miles of the place. Elmer
himself was wild to try the fishing there, for he
fancied that the bass must be enormous fellows,
and as gamey as could be found anywhere. Lil
Artha, too, would be sure to want to make more
than one trip across country, and spend a few
hours casting in the almost virgin waters in the
solitudes where sportsmen had possibly seldom
invaded.</p>

<p>Conrad kept up amazingly, but then it was love
that gave him additional strength, and Elmer
knew full well what that could do for any one.
Many times they heard some slight sound that
gave them a start, for their nerves being on edge
they imagined every such noise to be a feeble cry
for help. The snappy bark of a red squirrel as
he clung head downward to the lower trunk of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
a tree, and watched the intruders of his sacred
realm; the sudden cawing of a startled crow; the
rasping cry of a bluejay; or it might be the distant
screech of an eagle poised above some fish-hawk
that had darted down and secured its dinner
which the bald-headed robber of the air
would snatch away from him presently, after a
swift pursuit upwards&mdash;all these they heard, and
many times did one of the greenhorns ask to be
told what it meant.</p>

<p>Still nothing was seen or heard to indicate that
Jem Shock had been overtaken by a falling tree
while on his way from the first lake. They did
come across several such overthrown monarchs
of the forest that had fallen close to the trail; and
once the way was really blocked by a mass of
broken limbs, together with the heavy trunk of a
tree that had come crashing down.</p>

<p>Conrad darted hastily forward before Elmer
could interfere, and was looking, oh, so eagerly,
and with such an expression of anxiety, for any
sign to indicate that the dear one he sought might
be lying under the wreckage.</p>

<p>"Father, father!" he called out, with such a
plaintive ring to his voice that Rufus felt something
rising in his throat; while Alec McGregor
might have been seen to turn his head aside, and
then violently blow his nose, as though he had
taken cold.</p>

<p>But there was no response. Elmer and Lil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Artha went all around the fallen tree, and even
crawled underneath the same to make positive
that Jem was not there. Finally even Conrad
became assured as to this, for he expressed an
eagerness to once more go on.</p>

<p>So they proceeded. From the lay of the land,
and other signs that his quick eye caught, Elmer
guessed that they could not be far away from the
first lake. Perhaps he was guided somewhat in
making this decision by the sight of that fish-hawk
or osprey, which he knew would be apt to hover
over a body of water, since it must obtain its
whole sustenance from the lakes.</p>

<p>"What's that glistening in the sunlight yonder,
Elmer?" suddenly asked Alec, who, it seemed,
possessed a pair of incredibly keen eyes.</p>

<p>Lil Artha laughed.</p>

<p>"That's one on us, Elmer," he remarked, "when
a tenderfoot is the first to discover the presence
of water. I reckon now, Alec, you've got the making
of a pretty good scout in you, if you stick at
it; and they do say the Scotch are the most persevering
chaps going. That's the lake, the first
one Conrad told us about, I should say."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's the first one," hurriedly admitted
the boy, "and we'll soon reach its border. You
will say that it's a lovely little sheet of water, too.
Father told me he had never set eyes on one that
struck him as more beautiful. And I love to sit
and look out over it when the wind dimples the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
surface, or it is so quiet that you can see a picture
all along the shore, with the trees reflected in the
water like a big looking-glass."</p>

<p>"Then we'll have to call it Mirror Lake," said
Lil Artha, struck by the wonderful poetic way in
which the small boy described things, which may
in part have come to him through his mother.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is what my mother calls it," Conrad
instantly told him; "for once she crossed over
with me to see the water. We shall be there very
soon now, in less than ten minutes I think."</p>

<p>Nothing further occurred to startle them during
the balance of the time that was consumed in covering
the ground separating them from the shore
of the lake. When Elmer and his three comrades
found themselves staring out upon that wonderfully
clear and altogether charming body of water,
they felt that words must fail to describe it and
do justice. Elmer had looked upon a good many
pretty lakes, both large and small, but never one
the equal of this.</p>

<p>As for Lil Artha, he knew now what would be
occupying considerable of his spare time during
the balance of their stay in camp. Why, even as
he looked he could see big bass "break" here and
there, as though they might be feeding on flies,
late though the season was. All the sporting
blood Lil Artha possessed was on fire at the sight.
He had resolved to give up much of his love for
hunting, because of the change that had taken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
place of late in his ideas concerning the cruelty of
such sport; but nothing would ever cause him to
lose that eager desire to match his wits and a
slender line with a fly attached to the leader
against the strength and cunning of a bronze-backed
black bass, and see which could win in the
struggle for supremacy.</p>

<p>"Oh! listen, please!" exclaimed the boy, anxiously,
his very soul in his voice.</p>

<p>"That was only a kingfisher calling," said Lil
Artha, who knew all about such things; "see, there
he flits across that little bayou, and perches on
the limb that overhangs the water. He's after his
dinner, I guess, and was calling to his mate. But
lead the way, Conrad, and we'll keep along after
you."</p>

<p>They began to follow the uneven indentations
of the shore. Elmer knew that this must be the
favorite course taken by the fish poacher when
going to see what his set lines held. A plain trail
it was, and even Rufus or Alec might have followed
it most of the way; though at times they
would have hard work to pick it out, since the
heavy rain had washed things pretty badly.</p>

<p>But Conrad knew where he was going, and just
at which point they were to turn their backs on
Mirror Lake, heading for its mate near by.</p>

<p>"We'll like as not run across the intake or outlet
of this water," Lil Artha told the two new scouts,
"because, of course, the lakes are connected by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
a little stream. And sure enough, there it is right
now."</p>

<p>Both tenderfeet were visibly impressed with
this show of knowledge on the part of the elongated
scout. Doubtless they mentally determined
that eventually they too would be able to tell just
such things by using the power of deduction that
a scout's education puts into his head.</p>

<p>Conrad turned sharply upon arriving at the
small stream. Elmer noticed that it ran <i>from</i> the
lake they were just in the act of leaving; and this
fact told him the other must set somewhat lower
down, and have an outlet of its own.</p>

<p>All these things were interesting enough to fellows
who had made a habit of observing whatever
took place around them; nevertheless, Elmer
wished the main object of their coming might be
attained without much further loss of time. He
was himself beginning to grow exceedingly nervous
from the long-continued strain; and could understand
just how poor Conrad must feel.</p>

<p>Lil Artha was more and more amazed to learn
what a wild bit of scenery lay within thirty miles
of the home town. He never would have believed
it possible, had he been told about it by any one;
but seeing is a convincing way of settling things,
and Lil Artha certainly knew he could depend on
his own eyes.</p>

<p>Through small openings among the trees they
quickly caught glimpses of the other sheet of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
water. The second lake was about the same in
size as the first, but lacked of the wonderfully
rugged surroundings that made the other so
beautiful. Still, had they not set eyes on Mirror
Lake, the boys would have quickly called this one
a spot well worth a long tramp just to see, not to
mention its potentialities along the line of fishing.</p>

<p>Once again they had come across a fallen tree
that lay close to the trail, even bridging the little
stream with its trunk, and forming a picture that
Elmer immediately resolved to take with his snapshot
camera before leaving the region.</p>

<p>"Looks to me," remarked Rufus shrewdly, "as
if the old storm must have hit this particular section
a whole lot more violently than any place
we've struck so far. Right from where we stand
I can see three, yes, four trees that have been
uprooted, and tumbled over, all lying in the same
direction, too, which is odd, I should think."</p>

<p>"Oh! that's a common occurrence," said Lil
Artha, "I've seen hundreds of fallen trees in a
place where a hurricane passed through the timber,
and they lay like a sheaf of matches, all in the
same identical direction. You see, the same wind
took them down, as it did here. But so far as I
can notice, there's no sign of anybody under this
tree; how about it, Elmer?"</p>

<p>"No, he wasn't here when this fellow crashed
down," admitted the other, in a satisfied tone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
"He had either passed farther along, or else had
not reached this place."</p>

<p>"Then let's go on farther," pleaded Conrad.</p>

<p>Lil Artha knew that their chances of finding
Jem were gradually getting less and less, as they
covered more of the ground he must have passed
over. He wondered what they should do if after
all their efforts they could manage to obtain no
trace of the missing man. Perhaps it would be
good policy to head for the cabin, in the hope that
since Conrad had left, his father might have managed
to make his way home, and consequently
they would find him there, too weak and exhausted
to start out again.</p>

<p>"We must go around the lake, to make sure,"
the boy was saying in a strained tone that cut
Elmer to the heart, because he could understand
how Conrad must be beginning to fear that his
father was dead, since he did not answer any of
his cries.</p>

<p>As they began to circle the new sheet of water,
Conrad again lifted his childish treble and kept
calling that one word: "father!" He seemed to
have faith to believe that if only he could reach
the ears of Jem Shock, an answer of some kind
would be immediately forthcoming.</p>

<p>Again his appeals were mocked by some of the
startled birds, unaccustomed to having their solitary
haunts invaded by two-legged creatures that
gave forth such doleful sounds. Step by step the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
little party persevered along their course, following
the shore of the second lake. It was harder
going than before, because of the density of the
growth surrounding this body of water; but Conrad
kept along, always on the lookout for signs
or sounds that would assure him success was near
at hand.</p>

<p>After all, it was Lil Artha who gave the word,
and he thrilled them when he went on to say:</p>

<p>"I think I heard a voice just then, fellows, and
it seemed to come from over on the other side of
that little bayou just ahead of us. Get a good grip
on yourself, Conrad, because mebbe we're going
to find him right away."</p>

<p>The boy was really beyond the power of making
any verbal reply, but the look he threw Lil
Artha, because of those cheering words, was full
of gratitude. To gain the other side of the indentation,
they must go around for quite some
distance. Conrad, too, had by now managed to
remember something; and finding his voice he
weakly remarked:</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! I know now where we are. Father
told me he always had the best luck with a line
set from that point over there. The fish seem to
be larger than anywhere else about the lake, too.
Oh! and I can see that there is another big tree
down, right in sight!"</p>

<p>Elmer knew that this was so, for he himself had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
already made the same significant discovery. He
raised his voice and gave a lusty shout.</p>

<p>"Jem&mdash;Jem Shock, are you there?" was what
he called.</p>

<p>Then they all listened eagerly. A woodpecker
tapped noisily on a dead stump; but even the
breeze seemed to temporarily stop rustling
through the tops of the tall trees, as though sympathizing
with their anxiety, and bent on giving
all possible chances for their hearing any reply
to this hail.</p>

<p>"There, somebody answered you, Elmer,"
snapped Rufus, delightedly.</p>

<p>"We've found him," said Elmer, gravely. "Be
brave now, my boy," as he laid a hand affectionately
on the shoulders of poor trembling Conrad.
"For one thing, he's alive, and that's enough to be
thankful for."</p>

<p>"Yes, oh! yes, I <i>am</i> thankful!" cried the boy,
"but please hurry, Elmer. Oh! what he must have
suffered; but he <i>did</i> answer you, didn't he, and
so he must be alive! Poor father. We're coming!"
he tried to call aloud, though the effort only
resulted in a screech; "I'm here, father, your own
Conrad! Mother sent me to find you. Just be
patient, and we'll soon reach you. Oh! if only
I had wings how glad I would be!"</p>

<p>Elmer and Lil Artha led the way. They quickly
started around the tongue of marshy land bordering
the little bay, for the ground was low there;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
and doubtless the natural outlet of the twin lakes
would be discovered somewhere in that section, the
scouts concluded.</p>

<p>Now they were advancing upon the fallen tree.
They could see it was a big one, and that it reached
almost to the water's edge as it lay there, a derelict
of the recent storm.</p>

<p>Every eye was keenly on the alert to discover
a first sign of the unfortunate poacher who had
been caught, not by the stern hand of the law, but
through a freak of the storm, and pinned to the
ground, so that he was utterly helpless to free
himself from the toils.</p>

<p>Then Conrad gave a sudden shriek.</p>

<p>"I see him!" was the burden of his shrill cry.
"Oh! there, he moved and tried to wave his hand
at me! Elmer, did you see him do that? He's
really alive, and that is enough for me!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>RUFUS MAKES A STAND</div>


<p><span class="smcap">They</span> were quickly at the tree, for every one
just had to keep up with Conrad, who fairly flew
along, such was his eagerness. Elmer saw immediately
that they had a pretty tough job before
them, for the tree in falling had caught Jem Shock
fairly and squarely in a trap. A good-sized limb
bore him down so that he could hardly do more
than breathe.</p>

<p>His face was streaked with blood from various
scratches, and so he looked considerably worse
than might otherwise have been the case. At sight
of Conrad, however, he actually smiled, which was
enough to prove what a hold the lad had upon the
father's heart.</p>

<p>"We'll get you out of that in short order, Jem,"
said Elmer, promptly. "You see, we fetched our
ax along for just such a purpose. Lil Artha, get
busy, and start a cross-cut of this limb. Strike
in about here. I'll spell you if you want me to."</p>

<p>"Shucks! watch the chips fly, that's all!" jeered
the tall fellow, as he immediately set to work; and
the lively ring of steel smiting hard wood rang<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
through the aisles of the adjacent forest as well
as out upon the water of the second lake, where
a loon was swimming, and watching these newcomers
suspiciously.</p>

<p>Elmer noted the fact that the limb seemed to
have fallen directly across only one of Jem's legs,
a rather peculiar circumstance, by the way, he
considered. There was not the least doubt in his
mind but that the leg must have been broken;
indeed, he could already see that this was so. Apparently,
then, they must be ready to make that
stretcher which had already been mentioned to
the greenhorns; but then such a task presented
few real difficulties to experienced scouts, trained
in all the ways of the woods, where every one had
to <i>know</i> how to do things.</p>

<p>Conrad was fondling his father, who had one
free arm about the shoulders of the little chap.
No doubt Conrad took occasion to tell Jem how
kind these new friends of his had been, and how
readily they had responded to his appeal for assistance.</p>

<p>The scout-master wondered just how Jem would
take it. That proud spirit of his was bound to
show itself. He might feel indebted to the others,
and not mind so much, but to realize that one of
his rescuers was the son and heir of the very
Snodgrass whom he believed he had such abundant
cause to despise and hate, would gall him, and
"cut to the quick."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, Elmer, watching, could see the different
shades of feeling crossing the strong face of the
injured man, just as sometimes he had observed
clouds chasing athwart the blue sky in fleecy array.
Love for the child; pain because of his injury
and long wait there by the lakeside; suspicion
concerning the presence of Rufus Snodgrass, and
something like genuine gratitude toward the rest
of the scouts&mdash;all these varying emotions Elmer
could detect as they passed in review across the
face of the other.</p>

<p>In the endeavor to take Jem's thoughts from
his late precarious condition, Elmer now started
to talk with him, asking how it happened that a
woodsman of his long experience should be caught
by a falling tree in a storm.</p>

<p>The man laughed a bit harshly, as though disgusted
with himself.</p>

<p>"It was an accident, pure and simple, boy," he
went on to say. "Jem Shock never believed he
would be caught like a rat in a trap; but I ducked
the wrong way, my foot slipped, and before I
could recover I was down. So I've lain here for
hours, hoping my Conrad might come along, for
he knew about the lakes, and where I went to look
after my fish-lines. I never once thought about
you boys. Yes, I'm glad, of course, you came, because
Conrad never could have got me out alone;
only it hurts me to be beholden to <i>his</i> son."</p>

<p>And Rufus, hovering near by, heard this. His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
face flushed painfully, and he bit his lips until
the blood came, while his eyes flashed indignantly.
With an effort, however, he managed to get a grip
on himself. Perhaps it was the look he caught
on the face of the scout-master that brought this
about. At any rate, when Rufus spoke, his voice
was fairly calm; and, moreover, there was a note
of entreaty in it.</p>

<p>"Jem Shock," he said, in thrilling tones, while
the methodical "chunk" of Lil Artha's ax told how
its sharp edge was biting deeply into the hard
wood of that limb by which the man was pinned
down, "please listen to me. I can understand just
how you must feel while you believe my father
did you a great wrong. I don't blame you a particle
either, for feeling mean toward him. But
you must know that sometimes terrible mistakes
do happen, and that even the best of men may
blunder. I tell you I am dead sure such a thing
came about, and that at this day my father is
utterly unconscious of the fact that you believe
he wronged you."</p>

<p>"Not quite that, youngster," said the man
grimly. "He knows before now what my opinion
of Hiram Snodgrass is; because, after I learned
that he'd come to a town near by to live, I sent
him a letter."</p>

<p>Rufus refused to be disconcerted by this startling
intelligence.</p>

<p>"All right," he said, "I'm real glad you did,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Jem. My father ought to know what a cloud his
name is under. I meant to tell him all about it
myself just as soon as I got home from this trip.
Make your mind up you'll hear from him before
long, Jem. He'll never rest easy until he's investigated
the thing to the bottom, and found out
the whole truth. If some men bamboozled you,
and let you believe he was in the bunch, my father'll
fix them, all right. They'll do the right
thing by you when <i>he</i> gets after them with a sharp
stick, or I'll eat my head. I guess I ought to
know my dad better than anybody else could,
and he's straight as a die, even if he is a real
estate speculator."</p>

<p>Elmer was visibly impressed with the splendid
way in which Rufus stood up for his father. He
only hoped the elder Snodgrass might prove to be
just the kind of man the boy claimed. Jem Shock,
too, could not but be somewhat affected by the
sturdy championship of the accused man's cause;
though a sneer found a place on his blood-streaked
face, and his eye still showed signs of coldness and
unbelief.</p>

<p>At least, he allowed the subject to drop as
though he did not wish to say anything further
in that line, which was so unpleasant. He confined
himself to petting Conrad, and giving Lil
Artha further directions as to just how to finish
his task; for, as a competent woodsman, Jem
Shock knew all about the use of an ax. Elmer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
could see that, despite his agonizing condition, the
man had kept his wits about him.</p>

<p>Finally, the limb separated, and after that the
boys, by uniting their strength, were enabled to
raise the portion that still held Jem pinned down.
He wriggled free, although the pain was so great
that he almost fainted.</p>

<p>After that, Elmer took charge again. Water
was brought, and a fire made to warm it in the pail
Alec had been told to carry along. Once it was
heated, Elmer proceeded to cleanse first Jem's
face, so that he might not look so terribly grim;
and after that he started to get at the broken leg.</p>

<p>He found that it was indeed pretty serious, for
it had swollen dreadfully on account of the neglect;
but Elmer was a pretty good amateur surgeon,
as his chums all knew, and understood just
how to go about setting the fractured bone, after
carefully washing the limb.</p>

<p>Alec and Rufus had their hands full just about
that time. They did not want to lose a single
thing of all that was going on around them, and
were often called upon by Elmer to lend a helping
hand. It was noticeable that Rufus was always
the one to do this. Jem seemed to visibly shrink
from the touch of the boy's fingers, as though they
affected him somehow; but even this aversion
failed to prevent Rufus from persevering. Evidently,
he was determined that Jem should know
that the Snodgrass family did not have all the bad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
traits with which he, Jem, had in his mind endowed
them; and, besides, Rufus was bound to
keep in close touch with the man who had so long
believed ill of his father.</p>

<p>It pleased Elmer more than a little to notice
this trait in the tenderfoot. He believed Rufus
had the making of a good scout, and that association
with the other fellows of the troop would
in time serve to cast out the bad traits in his character
mainly produced through the mistaken
weakness of his adoring mother, who had always
given in to his every whim.</p>

<p>But the wonderfully clever way in which Elmer
managed to handle that broken leg, and then bind
it up carefully, was not the only thing Rufus and
Alec had to watch in their ardent desire to acquire
practical knowledge of what a scout should know.</p>

<p>There was the industrious Lil Artha, working
away like a trooper, and making a rude but amply
sufficient stretcher, on which the wounded man
could recline, while four sturdy boys bore him
toward his home, since it would be utterly impossible
for Jem to even hobble, with that injured
limb under him.</p>

<p>Both greenhorns watched the stretcher grow,
and marveled at the skill displayed by the accomplished
Lil Artha, who felt proud to be the one
to show them how easy it was for a fellow who had
been taught to bring his knowledge into play when
the emergency arose.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally everything was done. Elmer had bound
the leg up so firmly that Jem was full of praise for
his work.</p>

<p>"I want to say that you boys sure know your
business," he told Elmer, still refusing to look
at the persistent Rufus, who continued to hover
near him, despite all these rebuffs, for he was a
stubborn fellow, it seemed, and would not abandon
his plans easily. "I've heard some about
scouts, and thought they didn't amount to much,
but I reckon I'll have to change my mind after this.
A regular sawbones couldn't have done the job
neater, Elmer. I'm thanking you for it too; and
I calculate that a lot Conrad's been telling us
about you must be true."</p>

<p>"Oh! it is, father, it is!" ejaculated the pleased
boy, with tears in his eyes. "Elmer is just a grand
fellow; and besides, he promised me that I'd get
a chance to be taught by some one who would know
what to do with me. You'll not set your foot down
on that, will you, father?"</p>

<p>The man smiled grimly, though this changed
to a tender look as he smoothed the fair hair of
his little son.</p>

<p>"We'll see, Conrad, we'll see," he told him.
"Just now it don't look like I could set one of my
feet down on anything for a month or more. But
they're going to have a hard job of it getting a
heavy man like me all the way home."</p>

<p>"Oh! don't you worry about that, Jem Shock!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
sang out Lil Artha, blithely enough; "we know
just how to go about it; and besides, it isn't going
to be such a very tough task divided among four
of us. Now, Rufus, you can take the upper left
end, and I'll look after the right. Elmer and Alec
will manage the foot of the stretcher easy
enough."</p>

<p>Rufus shot him a look of gratitude, showing that
he readily understood how the wise Lil Artha had
purposely allotted him one of the holds that would
be apt to keep him as close to Jem's face as possible.
The elongated scout evidently considered
it good policy to force Jem to grow accustomed
to the proximity of a Snodgrass; while familiarity
is said to often breed contempt, in this case Lil
Artha meant that it should be the cause of a growing
confidence.</p>

<p>So they gaily started forth. Conrad ran alongside,
and at times persisted in keeping hold of his
father's hand. He would now and then utter
words calculated to cheer the other up, as though
he feared that the strain of the trip, on top of his
father's condition after lying there so long unattended,
might cause him to show signs of a
relapse.</p>

<p>But they got along famously. The first lake was
soon reached and put behind them. Lil Artha
cast several longing glances over his shoulder as
they left, and it did not need the aid of a prophet
to tell that he was making up his mind to be back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
there the first thing in the morning, to test the
voracity of the bass fighters that dwelt in those
waters.</p>

<p>Following the plain trail, they continued to put
much ground between themselves and the spot
where they had found Jem. The man bore the
journey well, all things considered, though many
times Elmer could see him compress his jaws as
if to better stand the acute pain that shot through
his bruised body.</p>

<p>So they finally drew near the clearing where the
cabin stood. Elmer, who had been there once
before, as will be remembered, saw familiar signs
to tell him of this fact, for he had impressed certain
landmarks on his memory.</p>

<p>"Oh, listen!" suddenly exclaimed Conrad, "I hear
voices, and they are men talking, too, strangers.
What can it mean, father?"</p>

<p>The man on the stretcher winced painfully, and
then smiled grimly.</p>

<p>"Well, things generally come with a rush, Conrad,"
he said. "There are some men that have
been wanting to interview me for a long time now.
I reckon they've found the nerve to come away
up here, just to see what's going on. But they've
got to have proof in order to convict a man of
poaching game out of season. Anyhow, I'm in no
condition to resist now; and I don't believe they'll
stir up any evidence around the cabin. Woods
mutton is scarce these days."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Rufus who now uttered a cry.</p>

<p>"There, I can see several men now in front of
a cabin," he went on to say, "and oh! as sure as
you live, one of them is my own father! Do you
hear that, Jem Shock, the Snodgrass you've been
believing cheated you in a land deal has come
straight up here to see you just as soon as he got
that letter of yours. Does that look like guilt, tell
me? Oh! something is going to happen, and before
long you'll be changing your mind about the
Snodgrass tribe!"</p>

<p>Quickening their pace, the little procession hastened
to reach the cabin, where several men stood
watching their coming, with both wonder and interest
showing on their faces. The good wife ran
out to meet them, and was soon crying copiously
over the figure on the stretcher, though Jem told
her it was all right, and not to worry.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>"ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL!"</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a moment of considerable suspense to
the boys when Mr. Snodgrass, bustling forward,
looked down at the injured man. Jem with
clinched teeth glared up at him, but said nothing,
waiting for the other to speak.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to see you hurt in this way, Jem,"
said the magnate. "Just as soon as I received
your letter I went to the city, and had a little
heart-to-heart talk with Messrs. Bolten and Hall,
my former partners in that real-estate deal of
some years ago. I threatened them with immediate
prosecution if they did not own up to deceiving
both of us; and Jem, here they are ready
to eat humble pie, and make good that property
they defrauded you out of some years ago. Fool
that I was never to have suspected the truth; but
thank Heaven, it isn't too late yet. We'll soon fix
this thing; and after they've made good, Jem
Shock, I'm going to offer you my check for fifty
thousand dollars for that land of yours; because
it's doubled in value since you let it pass from
your hands."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>Rufus fairly beamed with happiness.</p>

<p>"What did I tell you, Jem Shock?" he burst out
with. "I knew my father wouldn't stand for a
crooked real estate deal. He's proud of the record
he's made, and lots of people think he's the only
honest land speculator there is. And now perhaps
you will shake hands with him, Jem; yes,
and with me, too. The Snodgrasses aren't so <i>very</i>
bad a tribe, once you get to know them."</p>

<p>Jem had some difficulty in grasping the wonderful
change that had come about in his financial
condition, when later on the two real estate men
admitted that they had played a sharp trick upon
him, for which they were genuinely sorry&mdash;Lil
Artha winked several times very hard when he
heard them say this, and thought of "alligator's
tears."</p>

<p>Jem even offered his hand to the man he had
for years been condemning as an unworthy friend,
and a treacherous dealer in land.</p>

<p>Conrad was the happiest little fellow imaginable.
He would run from his father to Elmer and
pat their hands; then back again to kiss his
mother, and possibly shake hands with Lil Artha,
Alec and Rufus.</p>

<p>"It's all happened because of the scouts coming
up here to camp," he said in the midst of his great
joy. "Oh! what don't we owe to you, Elmer?"</p>

<p>"He fixed my broken leg as fine as any army surgeon
could have done, for one thing," admitted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Jem Shock, now looking as though a great load
had been taken off his shoulders; "and for that
alone I could always remember the boy. Yes, it's
been a great day for all of us. I'm glad now that
tree caught me, and all the time I lie around waiting
for the bone to knit, I'll be saying that I got
just what I deserved for thinking evil of any
man."</p>

<p>"None of that, Jem," said Mr. Snodgrass, with
more or less asperity. "You were justified in holding
hard feelings toward me, and thinking me a
scoundrel. For once in my life I allowed a pair
of precious knaves to dupe me, and never suspected
how matters stood until I had your letter.
But I forced them to make restitution. I stood
ready to land them both behind the bars if they
refused."</p>

<p>Messrs. Bolten and Hall had departed before
this was said, pleading an important engagement,
and promising to do anything else Mr. Snodgrass
demanded, so long as he kept his word not to make
the affair public, as it would ruin their legitimate
business to have it known that they had been concerned
in one big shady deal. Doubtless their ears
must have burned as they retraced their way in
the direction of the car that had brought them
from the distant station; but then, since all was
now well, even Jem Shock could forgive them.</p>

<p>While Mr. Snodgrass spent two days in camp
with the boys, he had plenty of chances of hearing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Conrad play, for the boy kept his promise to
come over with his wonderful Stradivarius violin,
and charm them with his magical music. The
gentleman agreed with Elmer that the child was
very precocious, and had the "touch" that had
made his grandfather illustrious.</p>

<p>"It would be a great crime," he said, "if such
wonderful genius failed to find expression. If
his father was unable to send him to the right
master I'd certainly insist on it myself. And between
us, boys, I'm determined on forcing Jem
Shock to allow me to advance all the funds needed
to put Conrad where he belongs. It's the only
way I can make up in part for my unconscious
share in his troubles."</p>

<p>Later on this same thing was arranged, and
Conrad, it is needless to say, is at present studying
hard under the best violin teacher in New York.
Those who watch his career are loud in their
praise, and say that when his time comes to appear
in public, all such stars as Elman, Kreisler
and Maud Powell will have to take a "back seat."</p>

<p>Of course since George had not been present
when all these wonderful events came about, the
others were forced to give him every possible opportunity
to learn the exciting details. He asked
a thousand questions, and heard the whole story
told over and over again, from the time the expedition
left camp up to the unexpected meeting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
between Jem and Mr. Snodgrass, and the humbling
of the pair of precious real estate sharks.</p>

<p>Indeed, it usually did take several tellings to
convince so skeptical a fellow as Doubting George,
especially when there was something quite out of
the common going on.</p>

<p>The balance of the scouts' stay in camp up at
Raccoon Bluff was filled with all sorts of good
times. Lil Artha went fishing over at the twin
lakes, and came back with as heavy a load of fish
as he could stagger under. He announced that
never before in all his varied experience had he
known such gallant fighters as those bronzed-backed
warriors of Mirror Lake. His arms fairly
ached from reeling them in; and he would never
forget what a glorious morning he had had there.
Of course this caused Elmer also to long to wet
a line; and as Alec expressed a desire to see how
the thing was done over in America&mdash;he had actually
caught a big salmon once upon a time in
a Scotch loch&mdash;he insisted on going along.</p>

<p>This was only a part of the glorious times they
enjoyed. Rufus even got busy again with his surveyor's
outfit, and did a little more work, just
to "keep his hand in," he said; but as Alec had
other things on the programme that he fancied
much better than "running a line," or "slashing"
through a thicket with an ax and bush hook, he
absolutely balked on giving up much more time
to that sort of thing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>They took pictures, and Elmer made sure to
get one of the tree that in falling had arched the
streamlet in such a remarkable way. Elmer also
tried a few night exposures, catching some of the
prowling 'coons in the act of stealing bait from
a trap set so that when the trigger was sprung
there would be a flashlight exposure, and the
startled little animal would really take its own
picture, being "caught in the act."</p>

<p>Besides they paid many visits to Jem's cabin,
always carrying over heaps of good things to eat,
despite the protests of Conrad's mother. Elmer
explained that greedy George had deceived Rufus,
who provided the provender for the week's campaign;
and that consequently they had brought
enough along to last a whole month; which they
hated to "tote" back again, and so wished her to
accept a few trifles, because Jem would not be
able to be moved for some weeks, and hence no
supplies could be laid in.</p>

<p>Conrad, of course, always played for them, and
even George, whose ear for music was not of the
best, for he rather preferred ragtime to "classical
stuff," admitted that the little fellow did wield
a magical bow, and could fairly make that "fiddle
talk" when he got down to serious business.</p>

<p>They saw no more ferocious wildcats, though
for several nights after the storm, Rufus complained
that he was kept awake by some sort of
plaintive mewing, though he was unable to exactly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
locate the sounds. Elmer feared that this might
be caused by a kitten left behind by the cat Lil
Artha had been compelled to slay in order to save
Alec from rough clawing. He even hunted around
during the daytime, hoping to find the small beast,
but was unable to do so. Finally, the mewing was
heard no more; from which they concluded that
the kitten had either succumbed to hunger, or else,
being fairly able to provide for itself, had departed
for other fields.</p>

<p>The 'coons, however, afforded the campers no
end of amusement by their curious antics. George
gave it as his opinion that whoever named that
particular section of country Raccoon Bluff knew
his business, for never had he seen one half so
many of the "bushy-tails" as during their stay
there.</p>

<p>They proved to be great pests in the bargain,
stealing whatever cooked food was left over; and
becoming so tame, that it was a common occurrence
to have several prowling around at any time
of the day; while at night one of the campers
found it necessary to rush out of the tent several
times during the period of darkness in order to
"shoo" the impudent rascals away.</p>

<p>Mr. Snodgrass had enjoyed himself heartily
during the parts of two days he stayed with the
boys. He expressed deep regret that pressing
demands of business caused him to start back to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
town, Rufus seeing him safely to the nearest station,
some six miles distant, as the crow flies.</p>

<p>And from what they all saw of Mr. Snodgrass
during his stay, the others were inclined to believe
Rufus knew what he was talking about when he
so boldly told Jem Shock that his father was as
"honest as the day was long," and "the best man
that ever lived." Elmer concluded that any father
who had so lived that his boy believes this of him
has a right to be proud, and feel that "example is
much better than precept." Too many fathers,
Elmer realized, act upon the theory that a boy can
maintain his respect for his parent who advises
him to "do as I say, not as I do."</p>

<p>When finally the time came for breaking camp,
the two tenderfeet felt sure they had made giant
strides along the road that led to their goal&mdash;the
distinction of becoming a first-class scout. They
had learned innumerable things since leaving
home; indeed, life looked altogether different
nowadays, because they saw ten interesting things
where before there had appeared but one. And
the thirst for knowledge had gripped them so
that never again would either Rufus or Alec be
content to plod along as before, "seeing things
as through a glass darkly," and not more than
half comprehending what wonders surround boys
of today on every side, if only they have the
vision to notice and comprehend.</p>

<p>There is really no need for us to accompany<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Elmer, George, Lil Artha and the tenderfoot
squad home again. But the story of their achievements
while up there in camp at Raccoon Bluff
will always make a bright page in the annals of
the Hickory Ridge Boy Scouts. Of course we expect
to meet these good friends again at no far
distant day, in the pages of another volume,
wherein may be detailed further of their interesting
and often thrilling adventures. Until that
time comes we must lower the curtain, and write
the last words,</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
